*****************************************
Interprocess Communication and Networking
*****************************************

The modules described in this chapter provide mechanisms for different processes
to communicate.

Some modules only work for two processes that are on the same machine, e.g.
:mod:`signal` and :mod:`subprocess`.  Other modules support networking protocols
that two or more processes can used to communicate across machines.

The list of modules described in this chapter is:
