Following Jython's Development
==============================

Jython's development is communicated through a myriad of ways, mostly through
mailing lists, but also other forms.

.. _mailinglists:

Mailing Lists
-------------

The primary mailing list where discussions about Jython's development occur is
jython-dev_. The list is open to the public and is subscribed to by all core
developers plus many people simply interested in following Jython's
development. Discussion is focused on issues related to Jython's development,
such as how to handle a specific issue, a PEP, etc. Technical support questions
should not be asked here and instead should go to jython-users_.

Jython-checkins_ sends out an email for every commit to Jython's various
repositories from http://hg.python.org. All core developers
subscribe to this list and are known to reply to these emails to make comments
about various issues they catch in the commit.

There is a mailing list related to issues on the `issue tracker`_.
Subscribe to jython-bugs_ if you want  an email for all changes made to any
issue.

IRC
---

Some core developers enjoy spending time on IRC discussing various issues
regarding Jython's development in the ``#jython`` channel on
``irc.freenode.net``. This is also a place wher you can ask for help with
Jython, but the channel does not always have anyone around to answer.  You can
use freenode's `Web interface <http://webchat.freenode.net/>`_ if you don't
have an IRC client.


Blogs
-----

Several core developers are active bloggers and discuss Jython's development
that way. You can find their blogs (and various other developers who use Jython)
at http://planet.jython.org/.
