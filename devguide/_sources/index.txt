========================
Jython Developer's Guide
========================

.. note::
    These instrctions are a modified version of the
    `CPython devguide <http://docs.python.org/devguide/>`_

This guide is a comprehensive resource for :ref:`contributing <contributing>`
to Jython_ -- for both new and experienced contributors.  It is
:ref:`maintained <helping-with-the-developers-guide>` by the same community
that maintains Jython.  We welcome your contributions to Jython!


Quick Start
-----------

Here are the basic steps needed to get :ref:`set up <setup>` and contribute a
patch:

1. :ref:`Get the source code <checkout>`::

      hg clone http://hg.python.org/jython

2. :ref:`Build Jython <compiling>`::

      ant

3. :doc:`Run the tests <runtests>`::

      ant regrtest

4. Make the :doc:`patch <patch>`.
5. Submit it to the `issue tracker`_.


Quick Links
-----------

Here are some links that you probably will reference frequently while
contributing to Jython.

* `Issue tracker`_
* :doc:`faq`
* PEPs_ (Python Enhancement Proposals)

Contributing
------------

We encourage everyone to contribute to Jython and that's why we have put up this
developer's guide.  If you still have questions after reviewing the material in
this guide, then the `Python Mentors`_ group is available to help guide new
contributors through the process.  The :doc:`Developer FAQ <faq>` is another
useful source of information.

Guide for contributing to Jython:

* :doc:`setup`
* :doc:`help`
* :doc:`patch`
* :doc:`runtests`
* Beginner tasks to become familiar with the development process
    * :doc:`docquality`
    * :doc:`coverage`
* Advanced tasks for once you are comfortable
    * :doc:`silencewarnings`
    * Fixing issues found by the :doc:`buildbots <buildbots>`
    * :doc:`fixingissues`
* :ref:`tracker` and :ref:`helptriage`
    * :doc:`triaging`
* :doc:`communication`
* :doc:`coredev`
    * :doc:`committing`
    * :doc:`devcycle`
    * :doc:`buildbots`
    * :doc:`coverity`

It is **recommended** that the above documents be read in the order listed.  You
can stop where you feel comfortable and begin contributing immediately without
reading and understanding these documents all at once.  If you do choose to skip
around within the documentation, be aware that it is written assuming preceding
documentation has been read so you may find it necessary to backtrack to fill in
missing concepts and terminology.




Other Interpreter Implementations
---------------------------------

This guide is specifically for contributing to Jython_: A Python interpreter
focused on good integration with the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) environment.

There are other Python implementations, each with a different focus.  Like
CPython, they always have more things they would like to do than they have
developers to work on them.  Some major example that may be of interest are:

* CPython_: The Python reference interpreter, also called simply "Python"
* PyPy_: A Python interpreter focused on high speed (JIT-compiled) operation
  on major platforms
* IronPython_: A Python interpreter focused on good integration with the
  Common Language Runtime (CLR) provided by .NET and Mono
* Stackless_: A Python interpreter focused on providing lightweight
  microthreads while remaining largely compatible with CPython specific
  extension modules
