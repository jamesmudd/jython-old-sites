<h1>Chapter 11:&nbsp; Using Jython in an IDE<a class="headerlink" href="#chapter-11-using-jython-in-an-ide" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>In this chapter, we will discuss developing Jython applications
using two of the most popular integrated development environments,
Eclipse and Netbeans. There are many other development environments
available for Python and Jython today; however, these two are
perhaps the most popular and contain the most Jython-specific
tools. Eclipse has had a plug-in known as PyDev for a number of
years, and this plug-in provides rich support for developing and
maintaining Python and Jython applications alike. Netbeans began to
include Python and Jython support with version 6.5 and later. The
Netbeans IDE also provides rich support for development and
maintenance of Python and Jython applications.</p>
<p>Please note that in this chapter we will refer to Python/Jython as
Jython. All of the IDE options discussed are available for both
Python and Jython unless otherwise noted. For readability and
consistency sake, we&#8217;ll not refer to both Python and Jython
throughout this chapter unless there is some feature that is not
available for Python or Jython specifically. Also note that we will
call the plug-ins discussed by their names, so in the case of
Netbeans the plug-in is called Netbeans Python Plug-in. This
plug-in works with both Python and Jython in all cases.</p>
<div class="section" id="eclipse">
<h2>Eclipse<a class="headerlink" href="#eclipse" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Naturally, you will need to have Eclipse installed on your machine
to use Jython with it. The latest available version when this book
is being written is Eclipse 3.5 (also known as Eclipse Galileo),
and it is the recommended version to use to follow this section.
Versions 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 will work, too, although there will be
minor user interface differences which may confuse you while
following this section.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t have Eclipse installed on your machine, go to
www.eclipse.org/downloads and download the version for Java
developers.</p>
<div class="section" id="installing-pydev">
<h3>Installing PyDev<a class="headerlink" href="#installing-pydev" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Eclipse doesn&#8217;t include built-in Jython support. Thus, we will use
PyDev, an excellent plug-in which adds support for the Python
language and includes specialized support for Jython. PyDev&#8217;s home
page is <a class="reference external" href="http://pydev.org">http://pydev.org</a>, but you won&#8217;t need to manually download
and install it.</p>
<p>To install the plug-in, start Eclipse and go to Help&gt;Install new
Software..., and type <a class="reference external" href="http://pydev.org/updates">http://pydev.org/updates</a> into the &#8216;Work with&#8217;
input box. Press Enter. After a short moment, you will see an entry
for PyDev in the bigger box below. Just select it, clicking on the
checkbox that appears at the left of PyDev (see Figure 11-1), and
then click the Next button.</p>
<img alt="PyDev Installation" src="_images/chapter11-pydev-installation-1.png" />
<p>Figure 11-1. Installing PyDev</p>
<p>After this, just follow the wizard, read the license agreement,
and, if you agree with the Eclipse Public License v1.0, accept it.
Then click the Finish button.</p>
<p>Once the plug-in has been installed by Eclipse, you will be asked
if you want to restart the IDE to enable the plug-in. As that is
the recommended option, do so. Once Eclipse restarts itself, you
will enjoy full Python support on the&nbsp;IDE.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="minimal-configuration">
<h3>Minimal Configuration<a class="headerlink" href="#minimal-configuration" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Before&nbsp;starting a PyDev project you must tell PyDev which Python
interpreters&nbsp;are available. In this context, an interpreter is just
a particular installation of some implementation of Python. When
starting you will normally only need one interpreter, and for this
chapter we will only use Jython 2.5.1. To configure it, open the
Eclipse Preferences dialog&nbsp;(via Windows&gt;Preferences in the main
menu bar). On the text box located at the top of the left panel
(called &#8216;Filter text&#8217;), type &#8216;Jython.&#8217; This will filter the myriad
of Eclipse (and PyDev!) options and will present us with a much
simplified view, in which you will spot the &#8216;Interpreter – Jython&#8217;
section on the left.</p>
<p>Once you have selected the &#8216;Interpreter – Jython&#8217; section, you will
be presented with an empty list of Jython interpreters at the top
of the right side. We clearly need to fix that! So, click the New
button, enter &#8216;Jython 2.5.1&#8217; as the Interpreter Name, click Browse,
and find jython.jar&nbsp;inside your Jython 2.5.1 installation.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">Even if this is the only runtime we will use in this
chapter, we recommend you use a naming schema like the one proposed
here, including both the implementation name (Jython) and the full
version (2.5.1) on the interpreter name. This will avoid confusion
and name clashing when adding new interpreters in the future.</p>
</div>
<p>After selecting the jython.jar file, PyDev will automatically
detect the default, global sys.path entries.&nbsp;PyDev always infer the
right values, so unless you have very special needs, just accept
the default selection and click OK.</p>
<p>If all has gone well, you will now see an entry on the list of
Jython interpreters, representing the information you just entered.
It will be similar to Figure 11-2 (of course, your filesystem paths
will differ).</p>
<img alt="PyDev Configuration: Jython Interpreter" src="_images/chapter11-pydev-configuration-1.png" />
<p>Figure 11-2. List of Jython interpreters</p>
<p>That&#8217;s all. Click OK and you will be ready to develop with Jython
while enjoying the support provided by a modern IDE.</p>
<p>If you are curious, you may want to explore the other options found
on the Preferences window, below the PyDev section (after clearing
the search filter we used to quickly go to the Jython interpreter
configuration). But in our experience, it&#8217;s rarely needed to change
most of the other options available.</p>
<p>In the next sections we will take a look to the more important
PyDev features to have a more pleasant learning experience and make
you more productive.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="hello-pydev-creating-projects-and-executing-modules">
<h3>Hello PyDev!: Creating Projects and Executing Modules<a class="headerlink" href="#hello-pydev-creating-projects-and-executing-modules" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Once you see the first piece of example code on this chapter, it
may seem overly simplistic. It is, indeed, a very dumb example. The
point is to keep the focus on the basic steps you will perform for
the lifecycle of any Python-based project inside the Eclipse IDE,
which will apply to simple and complex projects. So, as you
probably guessed, our first project will be a Hello World. Let&#8217;s
start it!</p>
<p>Go to File&gt;New &gt;Project. You will be presented with a potentially
long list of all the kinds of projects you can create with Eclipse.
Select PyDev Project under the PyDev group (you can also use the
filter text box at the top and type &#8216;PyDev Project&#8217; if it&#8217;s faster
for you).</p>
<p>The next dialog will ask you for your project properties. As the
project name, we will use LearningPyDev. In the &#8216;Project contents&#8217;
field, check the &#8216;Use default&#8217; checkbox, so PyDev will create a
directory with the same name as the project inside the Eclipse
workspace (which is the root path of your eclipse projects).
Because we are using Jython 2.5.1, we will change the project type
to Jython and the grammar version to 2.5. We will leave the
Interpreter alone, which will default to the Jython interpreter we
just defined on the Minimal Configuration section. We will also
leave checked the &#8216;Create default &#8216;src&#8217; folder and add it to the
pythonpath&#8217; option, because it&#8217;s a common convention on Eclipse
projects.</p>
<p>After you click Finish, PyDev will create your project, which will
only contain an empty src directory and a reference to the
interpreter being used. Let&#8217;s create our program now.</p>
<p>Right-click on the project, and select New&gt;PyDev Module. Leave the
Package blank and enter &#8216;main&#8217; in the Name field. PyDev offers some
templates to speed up the creation of new modules, but we won&#8217;t use
them, as our needs are rather humble. So leave the Template field
empty and click Finish.</p>
<p>PyDev will present you an editor for the main.py file&nbsp;it just
created. It&#8217;s time to implement our program. Write the following
code in the editor:</p>
<p>Listing 11-1.</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>if __name__ == "__main__":
    print "Hello PyDev!"</pre>
</div>
<p>and then press Ctrl + F11&nbsp;to run this program. Select Jython Run
from the dialog presented and click OK. The program will run and
the text &#8216;Hello PyDev!&#8217; will appear on the console, located on the
bottom area of the IDE.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">When describing the hotkeys&nbsp;(such as Ctrl + F11 for
&#8216;Jython Run&#8217;), we&#8217;re using the PC keyboard convention. Mac
users&nbsp;should press the Command key instead of Ctrl for all the
hotkeys listed on this chapter, unless otherwise noted.</p>
</div>
<p>If you manually typed the program, you probably noted that the IDE
knows that in Python a line ending in &#8216;:&#8217; marks the start of a
block and will automatically put your cursor at the appropriate
level of indentation in the next line. See what happens if you
manually override this decision and put the print statement at the
same indentation level of the if statement and save the file. The
IDE will highlight the line flagging the error. If you hover at the
error mark, you will see the explanation of the error, as seen in
Figure 11-3.</p>
<img alt="PyDev Highlighting a Simple Error" src="_images/chapter11-pydev-editing-1.png" />
<p>Figure 11-3. Error explanation appears when you hover over the
error mark.</p>
<p>Expect the same kind of feedback for whatever syntax error you
made. It helps to avoid the frustration of going on edit-run loops
only to find further minor syntax errors.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="passing-command-line-arguments-and-customizing-execution">
<h3>Passing Command-line Arguments and Customizing Execution<a class="headerlink" href="#passing-command-line-arguments-and-customizing-execution" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Command line arguments may seem old fashioned, but they are
actually a very simple and effective way to let programs interact
with the outside. Because you have learned to use Jython as a
scripting language, it won&#8217;t be uncommon to write scripts that will
take their input from the command line (note that for unattended
execution, reading input from the command line is way more
convenient that obtaining data from the standard input, let alone
using a GUI).</p>
<p>As you have probably guessed, we will make our toy program to take
a command line argument. The argument will represent the name of
the user to greet, to build a more personalized solution. Here is
how our main.py should look:</p>
<p>Listing 11-2.</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">sys</span>
<span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">__name__</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s">&quot;__main__&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="nb">len</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">sys</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">argv</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="mf">2</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="k">print</span> <span class="s">&quot;Sorry, I can&#39;t greet you if you don&#39;t say your name&quot;</span>
    <span class="k">else</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="k">print</span> <span class="s">&quot;Hello </span><span class="si">%s</span><span class="s">!&quot;</span> <span class="o">%</span> <span class="n">sys</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">argv</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mf">1</span><span class="p">]</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>If you hit Ctrl + F11&nbsp;again, you will see the &#8216;Sorry I can&#8217;t greet
you...&#8217; message on the console. It makes sense, because you didn&#8217;t
pass the name. Not to say that it was your fault, as you didn&#8217;t
have a chance to say your name.</p>
<p>To specify command line arguments, go to the Run&gt;Run Configurations
menu, and you will find an entry named &#8216;LearningPyDev main.py&#8217; in
the Jython Run section on the left. It will probably be already
selected, but if it&#8217;s not, select it manually. Then, on the main
section of the dialog, you will find ways to customize the
execution of our script. You can change aspects such as the current
directory, pass special argument to the JVM, change the interpreter
to use, set environment variables, and so on. We just need to
specify an argument, so let&#8217;s type &#8216;Bob&#8217; in the &#8216;Program arguments&#8217;
box and click Run.</p>
<p>As you&#8217;d expect, the program now prints &#8216;Hello Bob!&#8217; on the
console. Note that the value you entered is remembered; that is, if
you press Ctrl + F11&nbsp;now, the program will print &#8216;Hello Bob!&#8217;
again. Some people may point out that this behavior makes testing
this kind of program very awkward, because the Run Configurations
dialog&nbsp;will have to be opened each time the arguments need to be
changed. But if we really want to test our programs (which is a
good idea), we should do it in the right way. We will look into
that soon, but first let&#8217;s finish our tour on basic IDE features.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="playing-with-the-editor">
<h3>Playing with the Editor<a class="headerlink" href="#playing-with-the-editor" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Let&#8217;s extend our example code a bit more, providing different ways
to greet our users, in different languages. We will use the
optparse module&nbsp;to process the arguments this time. Refer to
Chapter 9 if you want to remember how to use optparse. We will also
use decorators (seen in Chapter 4) to make it trivial to extend our
program with new ways to greet our users. So, our little
main.py&nbsp;has grown a bit now.</p>

<p>Take a little time to play with this code in the editor. Try
pressing Ctrl + Space&nbsp;(don&#8217;t change Ctrl with Command if you are
using Mac OS X; this hotkey is the same on every platform), which
is the shortcut for automatic code completion (also known as
Intellisense in Microsoft&#8217;s parlance) on different locations. It
will provide completion for import statements (try completing that
line just after the import token, or in the middle of the
OptionParser token) and attribute or method access (like on
sys.exit or parser.add_option or even in
JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE&nbsp;which is accessing a Java class!) It also
provides hints about the parameters in the case of methods.</p>
<p>In general, every time you type a dot, the automatic completion
list will pop up, if the IDE knows enough about the symbol you just
typed to provide help. But you can also call for help at any point.
For example, go to the bottom of the code and type &#8216;message(.&#8217;
Suppose you just forgot the order of the parameters to that
function. Solution: Press Ctrl + Space&nbsp;and PyDev will complete the
statement, using the name of the formal parameters of the
function.</p>
<p>Also try Ctrl + Space&nbsp;on keywords like &#8216;def.&#8217; PyDev will provide
you little templates&nbsp;that may save you some typing. You can
customize the templates on the PyDev&gt;Editor&gt;Templates section of
the Eclipse Preferences window&nbsp;(available on the Window&gt;Preferences
main menu).</p>
<p>The other thing you may have noted now that we have a more sizable
program with some imports, functions, and global variables is that
the Outline panel&nbsp;on the right side of the IDE window shows a
tree-structure view of code being edited showing such features. It
also displays classes, by the way.</p>
<p>And don&#8217;t forget to run the code! Of course, it&#8217;s not really
spectacular to see that after pressing Ctrl + F11&nbsp;we still get the
same boring &#8216;Hello Bob!&#8217; text on the console. But if you edit the
command line argument (via the Run Configurations dialog) to the
following: &#8216;Bob &#8211;lang es &#8211;ui window,&#8217; you will get a nice window
greeting Bob in Spanish. Also see what happens if you specify a non
supported UI (say, &#8211;ui speech) or an unsupported language. We even
support the &#8211;help! So we have a generic, polyglot greeter which
also happens to be reasonably robust and user friendly (for command
line program standards that is).</p>
<p>At this point you are probably tired of manually testing the
program editing the command line argument on that dialog. Just one
more section and we will see a better way to test our program using
the IDE. Actually, part of the next section will help us move
toward the solution.</p>

<h3>A Bit of Structure: Packages, Modules, and Navigation<a class="headerlink" href="#a-bit-of-structure-packages-modules-and-navigation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>If you like simplicity you may be asking (or swearing, depending on
your character) why we over-engineered the last example. There are
simpler (in the sense of a more concise and understandable code)
solutions to the same problem statement. But we needed to grow the
toy code to explore another aspect of IDEs, which for some people
are a big reason to use them: organizing complex code bases. And
you don&#8217;t expect me to put a full-blown Pet Store example in this
book to get to that point, do you?</p>
<p>So, let&#8217;s suppose that the complications we introduced (mainly the
registry of UIs exposed via decorators) are perfectly justified,
because we are working on a slightly complicated problem. In other
words: let&#8217;s extrapolate.</p>
<p>The point is, we know that the great majority of our projects can&#8217;t
be confined to just one file (one Python module). Even our very
dumb example is starting to get unpleasant to read. And, when we
realize that we need more than one module, we also realize we need
to group our modules under a common umbrella, to keep it clear that
our modules form a coherent thing together and to lower the chances
of name clashing with other projects. So, as seen in Chapter 8, the
Python solution to this problem is modules and packages.</p>
<p>Our plan is to organize the code as follows: everything will go
under the package &#8216;hello.&#8217; The core logic, including the language
support, will go into the package itself (into its __init__.py
file) and each UI will go into its own module under the &#8216;hello&#8217;
package. The main.py script will remain as the command line entry
point.</p>
<p>Right-click on the project and select New&gt;PyDev Package. Enter
&#8216;hello&#8217; as the Name and click Finish. PyDev will create the package
and open an editor for its __init.py__ file. As we said, we
will move the core logic to this package, so this file will contain
the following code, extracted from our previous version of the main
code:</p>

<p>Note that we embraced the idea of modularizing our code, providing
exceptions to notify clients of problems when calling the greeter,
instead of directly printing messages on the standard output.</p>
<p>Now we will create the hello.console module&nbsp;containing the console
UI. Right-click on the project, select New&gt;PyDev Module, Enter
&#8216;hello&#8217; as the Package and &#8216;console&#8217; as the Name. You can avoid
typing the package name if you right-click on the package instead
of the project. Click Finish and copy the print_message
function&nbsp;there:</p>
<p>Listing 11-5.</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">hello</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">register_ui</span>

<p>Likewise, create the window module inside the hello package, and
put there the code for show_message_as_window:</p>
<p>Listing 11-6.</p>

</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="admonition tip">
<p class="first admonition-title">Tip</p>
<p class="last">Until now, we have used PyDev&#8217;s wizards to create new modules and
packages. But, as you saw on Chapter 7, modules are just files with the
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.py</span></tt> extension located on the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">sys.path</span></tt> or inside packages, and
packages are just directories that happen to contain a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">__init__.py</span></tt>
file. So you may want to create modules using <em>New ‣ File</em>
and packages using <em>New ‣ Folder</em> if you don&#8217;t like the
wizards.</p>
</div>
<p>Now we have our code split over many files. On a small project,
navigating through it using the left-side project tree (called the
PyDev Package Explorer) isn&#8217;t difficult, but you can imagine that
on a project with dozens of files it would be. So we will see some
ways to ease the navigation of a code base.</p>
<p>First, let&#8217;s suppose you are reading main.py&nbsp;and want to jump to
the definition of the hello.greet function, called on line 17.
Instead of manually changing to such a file and scanning until
finding the function, just press Ctrl and click greet. PyDev will
automatically move you into the definition. This also works on most
variables and modules (try it on the import statements, for
example).</p>
<p>Another good way to quickly jump between files without having to
resort to the Package Explorer is to use Ctrl + Shift + R, which is
the shortcut for &#8220;Open Resource&#8221;. Just type (part of) the file name
you want to jump to and PyDev will search on every package and
directory of your open projects.</p>
<p>Now that you have many files, note that you don&#8217;t need to
necessarily have the file you want to run opened and active on the
editor. For every script you run (using the procedure in which you
need to be editing the program and then press Ctrl + F11) the IDE
will remember that such script is something you are interested in
running and will add it to the &#8220;Run History&#8221;. You can access the
&#8220;Run History&#8221; on the main menu under Run -&gt; Run History, or in the
dropdown button located in the main toolbar, along the green &#8220;play&#8221;
icon. In both places you will find the latest programs you ran, and
many times using this list and selecting the script you want to
re-run will be more convenient than jumping to the script on the
editor and then pressing Ctrl + F11.</p>
<p>Finally, the IDE internally records a history of your &#8220;jumps&#8221;
between files, just like a web browser do for web pages you visit.
And just like a web browser you can go back and forward. To do
this, use the appropriate button on the toolbar or the default
shortcuts which are Ctrl + Left&nbsp;and Ctrl + Right.</p>

<h3>Testing<a class="headerlink" href="#testing" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Okay,&nbsp;it&#8217;s about time to explore our options to test our code,
without resorting to the cumbersome manual black box testing we
have been doing changing the command line argument and observing
the output.</p>
<p>PyDev supports running PyUnit tests from the IDE, so we will write
them. Let&#8217;s create a module named tests on the hello package with
the following code:</p>
<p>Listing 11-8.</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>import unittest
import hello
class UIMock(object):
    def __init__(self):
        self.msgs = []
    def __call__(self, msg):
        self.msgs.append(msg)
class TestUIs(unittest.TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        global hello
        hello = reload(hello)
        self.foo = UIMock()
        self.bar = UIMock()
        hello.register_ui('foo')(self.foo)
        hello.register_ui('bar')(self.bar)
        hello.message('foo', "message using the foo UI")
        hello.message('foo', "another message using foo")
        hello.message('bar', "message using the bar UI")
    def testBarMessages(self):
        self.assertEqual(["message using the bar UI"],
self.bar.msgs)
    def testFooMessages(self):
        self.assertEqual(["message using the foo UI",
                          "another message using foo"],
                          self.foo.msgs)

    def testListUIs(self):
        uis = hello.list_uis()
        self.assertEqual(2, len(uis))
        self.assert_('foo' in uis)
        self.assert_('bar' in uis)</pre>
</div>
<p>As you can see, the test covers the functionality of the
dispatching of messages to different UIs. A nice feature of PyDev
is the automatic discovery of tests, so you don&#8217;t need to code
anything else to run the previous tests. Just right-click on the
src folder on the Package Explorer and select Run As&gt;Jython
unit-test. You will see the output of the test almost immediately
on the console:</p>
<p>Listing 11-9.</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>Finding files...

</div>
<p>Python&#8217;s unittest is not the only testing option on the Python
world. A convenient way to do tests which are more black-box-like
than unit test, though equally automated is doctest.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">We will cover testing tools in much greater detail in
Chapter 18, so take a look at that chapter if you feel too
disoriented.</p>
</div>
<p>The nice thing about doctests&nbsp;is that they look like an interactive
session with the interpreter, which makes them quite legible and
easy to create. We will test our console module using a doctest.</p>
<p>First, click the right-most button on the console&#8217;s toolbar (you
will recognize it as the one with a plus sign on its upper
left-hand corner, which has the Open Console tip&nbsp;when you pass the
mouse over it). From the menu, select PyDev Console. To the next
dialog, answer Jython Console. After doing this you will get an
interactive interpreter embedded on the IDE.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s start exploring our own code using the interpreter:</p>
<p>Listing 11-10.</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">hello</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">console</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">console</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">print_message</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;testing&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="go">testing</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>We highly encourage you to type those two commands yourself. You
will note how code completion also works on the interactive
interpreter!</p>
<p>Back to the topic, we just interactively checked that our console
module works as expected. The cool thing is that we can copy and
paste this very snippet as a doctest that will serve to
automatically check that the behavior we just tested will stay the
same in the future.</p>
<p>Create a module named doctests&nbsp;inside the &#8216;hello&#8217; package and paste
those three lines from the interactive console, surrounding them by
triple quotes (because they are not syntactically correct Python
code after all). After adding a little of boilerplate to make this
file executable, it will look like this:</p>
<p>Listing 11-11.</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>"""
&gt;&gt;&gt; from hello import console
&gt;&gt;&gt; console.print_message("testing")
testing
"""
if __name__ == "__main__":
    import doctest
    doctest.testmod(verbose=True)</pre>
</div>
<p>After doing this, you can run this test via the Run&gt;Jython
run*menu* while doctests.py&nbsp;is the currently active file on the
editor. If all goes well, you will get the following output:</p>
<p>Listing 11-12.</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>Trying:
    from hello import console
Expecting nothing
ok
Trying:
    console.print_message("testing")
Expecting:
    testing
ok
1 items passed all tests:
   2 tests in __main__
2 tests in 1 items.
2 passed and 0 failed.
Test passed.</pre>
</div>
<p>After running the doctest you will notice that your interactive
console has gone away, replaced by the output console showing the
test results. To go back to the interactive console, look for the
console button in the console tab toolbar, exactly at the left of
the button you used to spawn the console. Then on the drop-down
menu select the PyDev Console, as shown in Figure 11-4.</p>
<img alt="Bringing back the interactive console." src="_images/chapter11-pydev-console-select.png" />
<p>Figure 11-4. Selecting PyDev Console</p>
<p>As you can see, you can use the interactive console to play with
your code, try ideas, and test them. And later a simple test can be
made just by copying and pasting text from the same interactive
console session. Of special interest is the fact that, because
Jython code can access Java APIs quite easily, you can also test
classes written with Java in this way.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="adding-java-libraries-to-the-project">
<h3>Adding Java Libraries to the Project<a class="headerlink" href="#adding-java-libraries-to-the-project" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Finally, we will show you how to integrate Java libraries into your
project. We said some pages ago that we could add a &#8216;speech&#8217;
interface for our greeter. It doesn&#8217;t sound like a bad idea after
all, because (like with almost any aspect) the Java world has good
libraries to solve that problem.</p>
<p>We will use the FreeTTS library, which can be downloaded from
<a class="reference external" href="http://freetts.sourceforge.net/docs/index.php">http://freetts.sourceforge.net/docs/index.php</a>. (You should download
the binary version.)</p>
<p>After downloading FreeTTS, you will have to extract the archive on
some place on your hard disk. Then, we will import a JAR file from
FreeTTS into our PyDev project.</p>
<p>Right-click the project and select Import. Then choose General&gt;File
System and browse to the directory in which you expanded FreeTTS
and select it. Finally, expand the directory on the left side panel
and check the lib subdirectory. See Figure 11-5.</p>
<img alt="Importing ``freetts.jar`` into the PyDev Project" src="_images/chapter11-pydev-importing-freetts.png" />
<p>Figure 11-5. Adding Java libraries to the project</p>
<p>After clicking Finish, you will see that the files are now part of
your project.</p>
<div class="admonition tip">
<p class="first admonition-title">Tip</p>
<p class="last">Alternatively, and depending on your operating system, the
same operation can be performed copying the files or folders from
the file manager and pasting it into the project (either via menu,
keyboard shortcuts, or drag and drop).</p>
</div>
<p>Now, the files are part of the project, but we need to tell PyDev
that lib/freetts.jar&nbsp;is a JAR file and should be added to the
sys.path of our project environment. To do this, right-click on the
project and select Properties. Then, on the left panel of the
dialog, select PyDev - PYTHONPATH. Then click the &#8216;Add zip/jar/egg&#8217;
button&nbsp;and select the lib/freetts.jar file&nbsp;on the right side of the
dialog that will appear. Click OK on both dialogs and you are ready
to use this library from Python code.</p>
<p>The code for our new hello.speech module&nbsp;is as follows:</p>
<p>Listing 11-13.</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>from com.sun.speech.freetts import VoiceManager
from hello import register_ui
@register_ui('speech')
def speech_message(msg):
    voice = VoiceManager().getVoice("kevin16")
    voice.allocate()
    voice.speak(msg)
    voice.deallocate()</pre>
</div>
<p>If you play with the code on the editor you will notice that PyDev
also provides completion for imports statement referencing the Java
library we are using.</p>
<p>Finally, we will change the second line of main.py&nbsp;from:</p>
<p>Listing 11-14.</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">hello</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="nn">hello.console</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="nn">hello.window</span>

</pre></div>
</div>
<p>in order to load the speech UI too. Feel free to power on the
speakers and use the &#8211;ui speech option to let the computer greet
yourself and your friends!</p>
<p>There you go, our humble greeter has finally evolved into a quite
interesting, portable program with speech synthesis abilities. It&#8217;s
still a toy, but one which shows how quickly you can move with the
power of Jython, the diversity of Java, and the help of&nbsp;an IDE.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="debugging">
<h2>Debugging<a class="headerlink" href="#debugging" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>PyDev also offers full debugging capabilities for your Jython code.
To try it just put some breakpoints in your code by double-clicking
on the left margin of the editor, and then start your program using
the F11 shortcut instead of Ctrl + F11.</p>
<p>Once the debugger hits your breakpoint, the IDE will ask you to
change its perspective. This means it will change to a different
layout, better suited for debugging activities. Answer Yes and you
will find yourself on the debugging perspective, shown in Figure
11-6.</p>
<img alt="PyDev's Jython Debugger." src="_images/chapter11-pydev-debug-session.png" />
<p>Figure 11-6. Debugging perspective</p>
<p>The perspective offers the typical elements of a debugger. In the
upper left area in the contents of the &#8216;Debug&#8217; tab&nbsp;we have the call
stack for each running thread. Click on an item of the call to
navigate to the particular line of code which made the
corresponding call. The call stack view also has influence over
what is shown by the Variables panel&nbsp;on the upper right-hand area,
which lists all the current local and global variables. You can
&#8216;drill down&#8217; on every non-primitive value to see its components, as
a tree. By default the variables shown are from the point of view
of the code being currently executed. But if we select a different
element on the call stack in the left area it will show the
variables for the line of code associated with that particular
stack frame.</p>
<p>Also in the same upper right-hand area there is the Breakpoints
tab, which is quite useful for taking a global look at all the
breakpoints defined. Clicking on the breakpoint entry will navigate
the code editor to the associated line of code, of course. And you
can disable, enable, and remove breakpoints by right-clicking on
the entries.</p>
<p>The rest of the elements are already known: the central area is
filled by the main editor (using less space this time to make room
for the extra tools) and its outline, while the output console
takes the lower area.</p>
<p>Once you reach a breakpoint you can control the execution, by using
Step Into (F5)&nbsp;to go into the code of the next function call, Step
Over (F6)&nbsp;to run the current line and stop again, Step Return
(F7)&nbsp;to execute the remaining code of the current function, and
Resume Execution (F8)&nbsp;to let the program continue running until the
next breakpoint is reached (or the program finishes).</p>
<p>Once you finish your debugging session, you can go back to the
normal editing perspective by selecting PyDev on the upper
right-hand area of the main IDE Window (which will have the Debug
button pushed while staying in the debugging perspective).</p>
<div class="section" id="conclusion-about-eclipse">
<h3>Conclusion about Eclipse<a class="headerlink" href="#conclusion-about-eclipse" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>PyDev is a very mature plug-in for the Eclipse platform, which can
be an important element in your toolbox. Automatic completion and
suggestions help a lot when learning new APIs (both Python APIs and
Java APIs!) especially if paired with the interactive console. It
is also a good way to introduce a whole team into Jython or into a
specific Jython project, because the project-level configuration
can be shared via normal source control systems. Not to mention
that programmers coming from the Java world will find themselves
much more comfortable on a familiar environment.</p>
<p>To us, IDEs are a useful part of our toolbox, and tend to shine on
big codebases and/or complex code which we may not completely
understand yet. Powerful navigation and refactoring abilities are
key to the process of understanding such projects and are features
that should only improve in the future. Even if the refactoring
capabilities are not still as complete as the state of the art on
Java IDEs, we encourage you to try them on PyDev: &#8216;Extract local
variable,&#8217; &#8216;Inline local variable,&#8217; and &#8216;Extract method&#8217; are quite
useful. Even if the alternative of doing the refactor manually
isn&#8217;t as painful with Python as with Java (or any other statically
typed language without type inference), when the IDE can do the
right thing for you and avoid some mechanical work, you will be
more productive.</p>
<p>Finally, the debugging capabilities of PyDev are superb and will
end your days of using print as a poor man&#8217;s debugger (seriously,
we did that for a while!) Even more advanced Python users who
master the art of import pdb; pdb.set_trace() should give it a
try.</p>
<p>Now, PyDev isn&#8217;t the only IDE available for Jython. If you are
already using the Netbeans IDE or didn&#8217;t like Eclipse or PyDev for
some reason, take a look at the rest of this chapter, in which we
will cover the Netbeans plug-in for Python development.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="netbeans">
<h2>Netbeans<a class="headerlink" href="#netbeans" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The Netbeans integrated development environment has been serving
the Java community well for over ten years now. During that time,
the tool has matured quite a bit from what began as an ordinary
Java development tool into what is today an advanced development
and testing environment for Java and other languages alike. As Java
and JavaEE application development still remain an integral part of
the tool, other languages such as JRuby, Python, Groovy, and Scala
have earned themselves a niche in the tool as well. Most of these
languages are supported as plug-ins to the core development
environment, which is what makes Netbeans such an easy IDE to
extend, as it is very easy to build additional features to
distribute. The Python support within Netbeans began as a small
plug-in known as nbPython, but it has grown into a fully featured
Python development environment and it continues to grow.</p>
<p>The Netbeans Python support provides developers with all of the
expected IDE features, such as code completion, color-coding, and
easy runtime development. It also includes some nice advanced
features for debugging applications and the like.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ide-installation-and-configuration">
<h2>IDE Installation and Configuration<a class="headerlink" href="#ide-installation-and-configuration" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The&nbsp;first step for installing the Netbeans Python development
environment is to download the current release of the Netbeans IDE.
At the time of this writing, Netbeans 6.7.1 is the most recent
release, but 6.8 is right around the corner. You can find the IDE
download by going to the web site www.netbeans.org and clicking on
the download link. Once you do so, you&#8217;ll be presented with plenty
of different download options. These are variations of the IDE that
are focused on providing different features for developers
depending upon what they will use the most. Nobody wants a bulky,
memory-hungry development tool that will overhaul a computer to the
extreme. By providing several different configurations of the IDE,
Netbeans gives you the option to leave off the extras and only
install those pieces that are essential to your development. The
different flavors for the IDE include Java SE, Java, Ruby, C/C++,
PHP, and All. For those developers only interested in developing
core Java applications, the Java SE download would suffice.
Likewise, someone interested in any of the other languages could
download the IDE configuration specific to that language. For the
purposes of this book and in our everyday development, we use the
All option, because as we enjoy having all of the options
available. However, there are options available for adding features
if you download only the Java SE or another low-profile build and
wish to add more later.</p>
<p>At the time of this writing, there is also a link near the top of
the downloads page for PythonEA distribution. If that link or a
similar Python Netbeans distribution link is available, then you
can use it to download and install just the Jython-specific
features of the Netbeans IDE. We definitely do not recommend taking
this approach unless you plan to purely code Python applications
alone. It seems to us that a large population of the Jython
developer community also codes some Java, and may even integrate
Java and Jython within their applications. If this is the case, you
will want to have the Java-specific features of Netbeans available
as well. That is why we do not recommend the Python-only
distribution for Jython developers, but the choice is there for you
to make.</p>
<p>Now that you&#8217;ve obtained the IDE, it is important to take a look at
the license. Python support for Netbeans is licensed under CDDL
version 1.0, so it may be a good idea to take a look at that as
well. It is easy to install in any environment using the intuitive
Netbeans installer. Perhaps the most daunting task when using a new
IDE is configuring it for your needs. This should not be the case
with Netbeans though because the configuration for Java and Python
alike are quite simple. For instance, if you working with the
fully-featured installation, you will already have application
servers available for use as Netbeans installs Glassfish by
default. Note that it is a smart idea to change that admin password
very soon after installation in order to avoid any potentially
embarrassing security issues.</p>
<p>When the IDE initially opens up, you are presented with a main
window that includes links to blogs and articles pertaining to
Netbeans features. You also have the standard menu items available
such as File, Edit, Tools, and so on. In this chapter we will
specifically cover the configuration and use of the Jython
features; however, there are very useful tutorials available online
and in book format for covering other Netbeans features. One thing
you should note at this point is that with the initial
installation, Python/Jython development tools are not yet installed
unless you chose to install the PythonEA distribution. Assuming
that you have installed the full Netbeans distribution, you will
need to add the Python plug-in via the Netbeans plug-in center. You
will need to go to the Tools menu and then open the Plug-ins
submenu. From there, you should choose the Available Plug-ins tab
and sort by category. Select all of the plug-ins in the Python
category and then install. This option will install the Python
plug-in as well as a distribution of Jython. You will need to
follow on-screen directions to complete the installation.</p>
<p>Once the plug-in has been successfully installed then it is time to
configure your Python and Jython homes. To do so, go to the Tools
menu&nbsp;and then open the Python Platforms menu&nbsp;as this will open the
platform manager for Python/Jython. At the time of this writing,
the default Jython version that was installed with the Python
plug-in was 2.5+. You most likely have your own Jython installation
by now that includes additional packages that you may wish to use.
As this is the case, go ahead and add your
Jython installation as a platform option and make it the default
(see Figure 11-7).</p>
<img alt="Netbeans Python Platform Manager." src="_images/chapter11-nbplatformmgr.jpg" />
<p>Figure 11-7. Adding your Jython installation as a platform option
and making it the default</p>
<p>To do so, click on the New button underneath the platform listing.
You can try to select the Auto Detect option, but we did not have
luck with Netbeans finding our Jython installation using it. If you
choose the New button, then you will be presented with a file
chooser window. You should choose the Jython executable that
resides in the area &lt;JYTHON_HOME&gt;/bin and all of the other
necessary fields will auto-populate with the correct values. Once
completed, choose the Close button near the bottom of the Python
Platform Manager window. You are now ready to start programming
with Python and Jython in Netbeans.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="advanced-python-options">
<h2>Advanced Python Options<a class="headerlink" href="#advanced-python-options" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>If you enter the Netbeans preferences window&nbsp;you will find some
more advanced options for customizing your Python plug-in. If you
go to the Editor tab, you can set up Python specific options for
formatting, code templates, and hints. In doing so, you can
completely customize the way that Netbeans displays code and offers
assistance when working with Jython. You can also choose to set up
different fonts and coloring for Python code by selecting the Fonts
and Colors tab. This is one example of just how customizable
Netbeans really is because you can set up different fonts and
colors for each language type.</p>
<p>If you choose the Miscellaneous tab&nbsp;you can add different file
types to the Netbeans IDE and associate them with different IDE
features. If you look through the pull-down menu of files, you can
see that files with the extension of py**or pyc are associated as
Python files. This ensures that files with the associated
extensions will make use of their designated Netbeans features. For
instance, if we wanted to designate**a different extension on some
Jython-related files*,* we could easily do so and associate this
extension with Python files in Netbeans. Of course, we do not
recommend doing so, as Jython will not import files with unknown
extensions! Once we&#8217;ve made this association then we can create
files with an extension of that we&#8217;ve added and use them within
Netbeans just as if they were Python files. Lastly, you can alter a
few basic options such as enabling prompting for python program
arguments, and changing debugger port and shell colors from the
Python tab in Netbeans preferences.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="general-python-usage">
<h2>General Python Usage<a class="headerlink" href="#general-python-usage" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>As stated previously in the chapter, there are a number of options
when using the Netbeans Python solution. There are a few different
selections that can be made when creating a new Python project. You
can either choose to create a Python Project*or*Python Project with
Existing Sources. These two project types are named quite
appropriately, as a Python Project will create an empty project;
once created it is easy to develop and maintain applications and
scripts alike. Moreover, you can debug your application via the
Python debugger as derived from&nbsp;Jean-Yves Mengant&#8217;s jpydbg
debugger, and have Netbeans create tests if you choose to do so.
One of the first nice features you will notice right away is the
syntax coloring in the editor.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="standalone-jython-apps">
<h2>Standalone Jython Apps<a class="headerlink" href="#standalone-jython-apps" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In this section, we will discuss how to develop a standalone Jython
application within Netbeans. We will use a variation of the
standard HockeyRoster application that we have used in other places
throughout the book. Overall, the development of a stand-alone
Jython application in Netbeans differs very little from a
stand-alone Java application. The main difference is that you will
have different project properties and other options available that
pertain to creating Jython projects. And obviously you will be
developing in Jython source files along with all of the
color-coding and code completion, and other options that the Python
plug-in has to offer.</p>
<p>To get started, go ahead and create a new Python Project by using
the File menu or the shortcut in the Netbeans toolbar. For the
purposes of this section, name the new project HockeyRoster.
Uncheck the option to Create Main File, as we will do this
manually. Once your project has been created, explore some of the
options you have available by right-clicking (Ctrl-click) on the
project name. The resulting menu should allow you the option to
create new files, run, debug, or test your application, build eggs,
work with code coverage, and more. At this point you can also
change the view of your Python packages within Netbeans by choosing
the &#8216;View Python Packages as&#8217; option. This will allow you the
option to either see the application in list or tree mode, your
preference. You can search through your code using the Find option,
share it on Kenai with the integrated Netbeans Kenai support,&nbsp;look
at the local file history, or use your code with a version control
system.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">In case you are not familiar with project Kenai, it is
an online service started by Sun Microsystems for hosting open
source projects and code. For more information, go to www.kenai.com
and check it out.</p>
</div>
<p>Click on the Properties option&nbsp;and the Project Properties
window&nbsp;should appear. From within the Project Properties window,
there are options listed on the left-hand side including
Source*,*Python*,*Run*,*and Formatting. The Source option&nbsp;provides
the ability to change source location or add new source locations
to your project. The Test Root Folders section&nbsp;within this option
allows you to add a location where Python tests reside so that you
can use them with your project. The Python option&nbsp;allows you to
change your Python platform and add locations, JARs, and files to
your Python path. Changing your Python platform provides a handy
ability to test your program on Jython and Python alike, if you
want to ensure that your code works on each platform. The Run
option&nbsp;provides the ability to add or change the Main module, and
add application arguments. Lastly, the Formatting option&nbsp;allows you
to specify different formatting options in Netbeans for this
particular project. This is great, because each different project
can have different colored text, and so on, depending upon the
options chosen.</p>
<p>At this point, create the Main module for the HockeyRoster
application. Go to File&gt;New and right-clicking (Cntrl-click) on the
project, or use the toolbar icon. From here you can either create
an Executable Module, Module, Empty Module, Python Package, or Unit
Test. Choose to create an Executable Module and name the main file
HockeyRoster.py*,* and keep in mind that when we created the
project we had the ability to have the IDE generate this file for
us but we chose to decline. Personally, we like to organize our
projects using the Python packaging system. Create some packages
now using the same process that you used to create a file and name
the package jythonbook. Once created, drag your HockeyRoster.py
module into the jythonbook package to move it into place. Note that
you can also create several packages at the same time by naming a
package like jythonbook.features or something of the like*,*which
will create both of the resulting packages.</p>
<p>The HockeyRoster**main module will be the implementation module for
our application, but we still need somewhere to store each of the
player&#8217;s information. For this, we will create a module named
Player. Go ahead and create an Empty Module named Player within the
same jythonbook package. Now we will code the Player class for our
project. To do so, erase the code that was auto-generated by
Netbeans in the Player.py module and type the following. Note that
you can change the default code that is created when generating a
new file by changing the template for Python applications.</p>
<p>Listing 11-15.</p>

</div>
<p>The first thing to note is that Netbeans will maintain your
indentation level. It is also easy to decrease the indentation
level by using the SHIFT + TAB keyboard shortcut. Using the default
environment settings, the keywords should be in a different color
(blue by default) than the other code. Method names will be in
bold, and references to self or variables will be in a different
color as well. You should notice some code completion, mainly the
automatic self placement after you type a method name and then the
right parentheses. Other subtle code completion features also help
to make our development lives easier. If you make an error,
indentation or otherwise, you will see a red underline near the
error, and a red error badge on the line number within the
left-hand side of the editor. Netbeans will offer you some
assistance in determining the cause of the error if you hover your
mouse over the red error badge or underline.</p>
<p>Now that we have coded the first class in our stand-alone Jython
application, it is time to take a look at the implementation code.
The HockeyRoster.py module is the heart of our roster application,
as it controls what is done with the team. We will use the shelve
technique&nbsp;to store our Player objects to disk for the roster
application. As you can see from the following code, this is a very
basic application and is much the same as the implementation that
will be found in the next chapter using Hibernate persistence.</p>

</div>
<p>The code should be relatively easy to follow at this point in the
book. The main function initiates the process as expected, and as
you see it either creates or obtains a reference to the shelve or
dictionary where the roster is stored. Once this occurs the
processing is forwarded to the make_selection() function&nbsp;that
drives the program. The important thing to note here is that, when
using Netbeans, the code is laid out nicely, and that code
completion will assist with imports and completion of various code
blocks. To run your program, you can either right-click
(Ctrl+click) on the project or set the project as the main project
within Netbeans and use the toolbar or pull-down menus. If
everything has been set up correctly, you should see the program
output displaying in the Netbeans output window. You can interact
with the output window just as you would with the terminal.</p>

<h2>Jython and Java Integrated Apps<a class="headerlink" href="#jython-and-java-integrated-apps" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Rather than repeat the different ways in which Jython and Java can
be intermixed within an application, this section will focus on how
to do so from within the Netbeans IDE. There are various approaches
that can be taken in order to perform integration, and this section
will not cover all of them. However, the goal is to provide you
with some guidelines and examples to use when developing integrated
Jython and Java applications within Netbeans.</p>
<div class="section" id="using-a-jar-or-java-project-in-your-jython-app">
<h3>Using a JAR or Java Project in Your Jython App<a class="headerlink" href="#using-a-jar-or-java-project-in-your-jython-app" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Making use of Java from within a Jython application is all about
importing and ensuring that you have the necessary Java class files
and/or JAR files in your classpath. In order to achieve this
technique successfully, you can easily ensure that all of the
necessary files will be recognized by the Netbeans project.
Therefore, the focus of this section is on using the Python project
properties to set up the sys.path for your project. To follow
along, go ahead and use your HockeyRoster Jython project that was
created earlier in this section.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s say that we wish to add some features to the project that are
implemented in a Java project named HockeyIntegration that we are
coding in Netbeans. Furthermore, let&#8217;s assume that the
HockeyIntegration Java project compiles into a JAR file. Let&#8217;s set
up the HockeyIntegration project by choosing New&gt;Project. When the
New Project window&nbsp;appears, select Java as the category, and Java
Application as the project and click Next. Now make sure you name
your application HockeyIntegration and click Finish. See Figure
11-8.</p>
<p>Your java application is now created and you are ready to begin
development. In order to use this project from within our
HockeyRoster project, you&#8217;ll need to open up the project properties
by right-clicking on your Jython project and choosing the
Properties option. Once the window is open, click on the Python
menu item on the left-hand side of the window. This will give you
access to the sys.path so you can add other Python modules, eggs,
Java classes, JAR files, and so on. Click on the Add button and
then traverse to the project directory for the Java application you
are developing. Once there, go to the dist directory and select the
resulting JAR file and click OK. You can now use any of the Java
project&#8217;s features from within your Jython application.</p>
<img alt="_images/image016.png" src="_images/image016.png" />
<p>Figure 11-8.</p>
<p>If you are interested in utilizing a Java API that exists within
the standard Java library, then you are in great shape. As you
should know by now, Jython automatically provides access to the
entire Java standard library. You merely import the Java classes
that you wish to use within your Jython application and begin
using, nothing special to set up within Netbeans. At the time of
this writing, the Netbeans Python EA did not support import
completion for the standard Java library. However, we suspect that
this feature will be added in a subsequent release.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="using-jython-in-java">
<h3>Using Jython in Java<a class="headerlink" href="#using-jython-in-java" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>If you are interested in using Jython or Python modules from within
your Java applications, Netbeans makes it easy to do. As mentioned
in Chapter 10, the most common method of utilizing Jython from Java
is to use the object factory pattern. However, there are other ways
to do this, such as using the clamp project, which is not yet
production-ready at the time of writing. For the purposes of this
section, we&#8217;ll discuss how to utilize another Netbeans Jython
project as well as other Jython modules from within your Java
application using the object factory pattern.</p>
<p>In order to effectively demonstrate the use of the object factory
pattern from within Netbeans, we&#8217;ll be making use of the PlyJy
project, which provides object factory implementations that can be
used out of the box. If you haven&#8217;t done so already, go to the
Project Kenai&nbsp;site find the PlyJy project and download the provided
JAR. We will use the Netbeans project properties window in our Java
project to add this JAR file to our project. Doing so will
effectively diminish the requirement of coding any object factory
implementations by hand and we&#8217;ll be able to directly utilize
Jython classes in our project.</p>
<p>Create a Java project named ObjectFactoryExample by selecting
New&gt;Project&gt;Java Application. Once you&#8217;ve done so, right-click
(Cntrl+click) on the project and choose Properties. Once the
project properties window appears, click the Libraries option on
the left-hand side. From there, add the PlyJy JAR file&nbsp;that you
previously downloaded to your project classpath. You will also have
to add the jython.jar file for the appropriate version of Jython
that you wish to use. In our case, we will utilize the Jython 2.5.1
release. See Figure 11-9.</p>
<img alt="_images/image018.png" src="_images/image018.png" />
<p>Figure 11-9. Adding the JAR file</p>
<p>The next step is to ensure that any and all Jython modules that you
wish to use are in your CLASSPATH&nbsp;somewhere. This can be easily
done by either adding them to your application as regular code
modules somewhere and then going into the project properties window
and including that directory in the Compile-Time Libraries list
contained the Libraries section, or by clicking the Add JAR/Folder
button. Although this step may seem unnecessary because the modules
are already part of your project, it must be done in order to place
them into your CLASSPATH. Once they&#8217;ve been added to the
CLASSPATH&nbsp;successfully, you can begin to make use of them via the
object factory pattern. Netbeans will seamlessly use the modules in
your application as if all of the code was written in the same
language. At this point your project should be set up and ready for
using object factories. To learn more about using object factories,
please refer&nbsp;to Chapter 10.</p>

<div class="section" id="the-netbeans-python-debugger">
<h2>The Netbeans Python Debugger<a class="headerlink" href="#the-netbeans-python-debugger" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>As mentioned previously, the Netbeans IDE also includes a Python
debugger that is derived from Jean-Yves Mengant&#8217;s&nbsp;jpydbg debugger.
This section will discuss how to make use of the Netbeans Python
debugger along with some examples using our HockeyRoster code that
was written in the previous section. If you have used a debugger in
another IDE, or perhaps the Java debugger that is available for
Netbeans, this debugger will feel quite familiar. The Python
debugger includes many features such as breakpoints, run-time local
variable values, code stepping, and more.</p>
<p>Prior to using the debugger, it may be useful to take a look at the
debugger preferences by navigating to the Netbeans
Preferences&gt;Python Options&gt;Debugger window. From there you will see
that you have the ability to change the debugger port, code
coloring for debugging sessions, and to stop at the first line of
the script or continue until the debugger reaches the first
breakpoint. To make the debugger feel and act similar to the
Netbeans Java debugger, you may want to de-select the &#8216;Stop at the
first line&#8217; checkbox. Otherwise the debugger will not load your
module right away, but rather stop execution at the first line of
your module and wait for you to continue. See Figure 11-10.</p>
<img alt="_images/image020.png" src="_images/image020.png" />
<p>Figure 11-10. The Netbeans Python debugger</p>
<p>Making use of the Python debugger included with Netbeans is much
like working from the Jython interactive interpreter from the
command-line or terminal window. If you have selected the &#8216;Stop at
first line&#8217; checkbox in the debugger preferences, the debugger will
halt at the first line of code in your main module and you must use
the debugger Continue button to move to the first line of code that
is executed. However, if you have de-selected the checkbox, then
the module will automatically run your program until it reaches the
first breakpoint. For the purposes of this exercise, let&#8217;s keep the
checkbox selected. In order to set a breakpoint, click on the
margin to the left of the line in your code where you would like
the debugger to halt program execution. In our case, let&#8217;s open the
HockeyRoster.py module and set a breakpoint in the code as shown in
Figure 11-11.</p>
<img alt="_images/image022.png" src="_images/image022.png" />
<p>Figure 11-11. Setting a breakpoint in the code</p>
<p>Now that we&#8217;ve set a breakpoint, we need to start our debugger.
However, prior to debugging it is important to make sure that
Netbeans knows which module to use for starting the program. To do
so, right-click on your project and select Properties. When the
properties window opens, select Run in the left-hand side of the
window. You should now type or browse to the module that you wish
to use as a starting point for your program. See Figure 11-12.</p>
<img alt="_images/image024.png" src="_images/image024.png" />
<p>Figure 11-12. Click Browse to select the module you wish to use as
a starting point.</p>
<p>Note that this may already be automatically filled in for you by
Netbeans. Once you&#8217;ve ensured that you have set the main module,
you can begin the debugging session. To do so, you can either
select your program and use the Debug menu option,&nbsp;or you can
right-click on the project and select Debug. Once you&#8217;ve started
the debugger, you will see a series of messages appearing in the
debugging window near the bottom of the IDE window to indicate that
the debugger has been started. After a few seconds, you will see
the messages stop writing in the debugger output window, and the
editor will focus on the first line of code in your main module and
highlight it in green. See Figure 11-13.</p>
<img alt="_images/image026.png" src="_images/image026.png" />
<p>Figure 11-13. Beginning the debugging session</p>
<p>To continue the debugger to the first line of code that is
executed, select the green Continue button in the toolbar, or press
the F5 key. You should see the program will begin to execute within
the debugger output window and it will halt to allow us to enter a
selection. See Figure 11-14.</p>
<img alt="_images/image028.png" src="_images/image028.png" />
<p>Figure 11-14. The debugger output window</p>
<p>Make sure your cursor is within the debugger output window and
enter 1 to add a player. When you hit the Enter button to continue,
the program will not continue to execute, but instead it will halt
at the breakpoint that we have set up. In the editor you will see
the line which we added a breakpoint to is now highlighted in
green. The debugger has suspended state at this point in the
program, and this affords us the ability to perform tasks to see
exactly what is occurring at this point in the program. For
instance, if you select the Variables tab&nbsp;in the lower portion of
the Netbeans IDE, you will be able to see the values of all local
variables at this current point in the program. See Figure 11-15.</p>
<img alt="_images/image030.png" src="_images/image030.png" />
<p>Figure 11-15. The values of all local variables at this current
point in the program</p>
<p>You can also select the Call Stack tab&nbsp;to see the execution order
of your program to this point. See Figure 11-16.</p>
<img alt="_images/image032.png" src="_images/image032.png" />
<p>Figure 11-16. The execution order of your program</p>
<p>Once you&#8217;ve evaluated the program at the breakpoint, you can
continue the program execution by stepping forward through the code
using the buttons in the toolbar. You can also click the Continue
button to run the program until it reaches the next breakpoint, or
in this case because we have no more breakpoints, it will just
continue the program execution as normal. The debugger is
especially helpful if you are attempting to evaluate a specific
line of code or portion of your program by stepping through the
code and executing it line by line.</p>
<p>Another nice feature of the debugger is that you can set certain
conditions on breakpoints. To do so, set a breakpoint in your code
and then right-click on the breakpoint and select Breakpoint and
then Properties from the resulting window. At this point you will
see the additional breakpoint options. In this case, set up a
condition that will cause the debugger to halt only if the
<em>selection</em> variable is equal to 3, as shown in Figure 11-17.</p>
<img alt="_images/image034.png" src="_images/image034.png" />
<p>Figure 11-17. Setting a condition for halting the debugger</p>
<p>At this point you can run the debugger again, and if you select the
option of 3 during your program execution you will notice that the
debugger will halt.</p>
<p>The Netbeans Python debugger offers enough options to fill up an
entire chapter worth of reading, but hopefully the content covered
in this section will help you get started. Once you&#8217;ve mastered the
use of the debugger, it can save you lots of&nbsp;time.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="other-netbeans-python-features">
<h2>Other Netbeans Python Features<a class="headerlink" href="#other-netbeans-python-features" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>There are a number of additional features in the Netbeans Python
IDE support that we haven&#8217;t touched upon yet. For instance, minimal
refactoring support is available for any Python module. By
right-clicking on the module in the project navigator or within a
module, a bevy of additional options become available to you via
the right-click menu. You&#8217;ll see that there is a Refactoring option
that becomes available. However at the time of this writing the
only available refactoring options were Rename, Move, Copy, and
Safely Delete. There is a Navigate feature&nbsp;that allows for one to
perform shortcuts such as highlighting a variable and finding its
declaration. The Navigate feature also allows you to jump to any
line in your code by simply providing a line number. If your Python
class is inheriting from some other object, you can use the
Navigate feature&nbsp;to quickly go to the super implementation. It is
easy to find the usages of any Python module, method, function, or
variable by using the Find Usages feature. If your code is not
formatted correctly, you can quickly have the IDE format it for you
by choosing the Format option, which is also available in the
right-click menu.</p>
<p>Another nice feature that is available in the right-click menu is
Insert Code. This feature allows you to choose from a number of
different templates in order to have the IDE auto-generate code for
you. Once you select the Insert Code option, another menu appears
allowing you to choose from a code templates&nbsp;including Property,
Constructor, Method, and Class. Once a template is chosen, the IDE
auto-generates the code to create a generic Python property,
constructor, method, or class. You can then refine the
automatically generated code to your needs. This feature allows the
developer to type less, and if used widely throughout a program it
can ensure that code is written in a consistent manner. See Figure
11-18.</p>
<img alt="_images/image036.png" src="_images/image036.png" />
<p>Figure 11-18. The very handy Insert Code option</p>
<p>Another nice feature is Fast Import. This allows you to highlight
an object in your code and automatically have the IDE import the
required module for using the object. You also have the ability to
Fix Imports, which will automatically clean up unused imports in
your code.</p>
<p>Along with all of the other features that are available with the
Netbeans IDE, these additional features are like the icing on the
cake! Keep in mind that you are not required to right-click each
time that you wish to use one of these additional features, there
are also keyboard shortcuts for each of them. The keyboard
shortcuts will differ depending upon which operating system you are
using.</p>

<h2>Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#summary" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>As with most other programming languages, you have several options
to use for an IDE when developing Jython. In this chapter we
covered two of the most widely used IDE options for developing
Jython applications, Netbeans and Eclipse. Eclipse offers a truly
complete IDE solution for developing Jython applications, both
stand alone and web-based. PyDev is under constant development and
always getting better, adding new features and streamlining
existing features.</p>
<p>Netbeans Jython support is in still in development at the time of
this writing. Many of the main features such as code completion and
syntax coloring are already in place. It is possible to develop
Jython applications including Jython and Java integration as well
as web-based applications. In the future, Netbeans Jython support
will develop to include many more features and they will surely be
covered in future releases of this book.</p>
<p>In the next chapter, we will take a look at developing some
applications utilizing databases. The zxJDBC API will be covered
and you&#8217;ll learn how to develop Jython applications utilizing
standard database transactions. Object relational mapping is also
available for Jython in various forms, we&#8217;ll discuss many of those
options as well.</p>
