Chapter 12: Databases and Jython: Object Relational Mapping and Using JDBC
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


In this chapter, we will look at zxJDBC package, which is a
standard part of Jython since version 2.1 and complies with the
Python 2.0 DBI standard. zxJDBC can be an appropriate choice for
simple one-off scripts where database portability is not a concern.
In addition, it’s (generally) necessary to use zxJDBC when writing
a new dialect for SQLAlchemy or Django. (But that’s not strictly
true: you can use pg8000, a pure Python DBI driver, and of course
write your own DBI drivers. But please don’t do that.) So knowing
how zxJDBC works can be useful when working with these packages.
However, it’s too low level for us to recommend for more general
usage. Use SQLAlchemy or Django if at all possible. Finally, JDBC
itself is also directly accessible, like any other Java package
from Jython. Simply use the java.sql package. In practice this
should be rarely necessary.

The second portion of this chapter will focus on using object
relational mapping with Jython. The release of Jython 2.5 has
presented many new options for object relational mapping. In this
chapter we’ll focus on using SQLAlchemy with Jython, as well as
using Java technologies such as Hibernate. In the end you should
have a couple of different choices for using object relational
mapping in your Jython applications.

ZxJDBC—Using Python’s DB API via JDBC
=====================================

The zxJDBC package provides an easy-to-use Python wrapper around
JDBC. zxJDBC bridges two standards:

JDBC is the standard platform for database access in Java.

DBI is the standard database API for Python apps.

ZxJDBC, part of Jython, provides a DBI 2.0 standard compliant
interface to JDBC. Over 200 drivers are available for JDBC
(http://developers.sun.com/product/jdbc/drivers), and they all work
with zxJDBC. High performance drivers are available for all major
relational databases, including DB2, Derby, MySQL, Oracle,
PostgreSQL, SQLite, SQL Server, and Sybase. And drivers are also
available for non-relational and specialized databases, too.

However, unlike JDBC, zxJDBC when used in the simplest way
possible, blocks SQL injection attacks, minimizes overhead, and
avoids resource exhaustion. In addition, zxJDBC defaults to using a
transactional model (when available), instead of autocommit.

First we will look at connections and cursors, which are the key
resources in working with zxJDBC, just like any other DBI package.
Then we will look at what you can do them with them, in terms of
typical queries and data manipulating transactions.

Getting Started
---------------

The first step in developing an application that utilizes a
database back-end is to determine what database or databases the
application will use. In the case of using zxJDBC or another JDBC
implementation, the determination of what database the application
will make use of is critical to the overall development process.
Many application developers will choose to use an object relational
mapper for this very reason. When an application is coded with a
JDBC implementation, whereas SQL code is hand-coded, the specified
database of choice will cause different dialects of SQL to be used.
One of the benefits of object relation mapping (ORM) technology is
that the SQL is transparent to the developer. The ORM technology
takes care of the different dialects behind the scenes. This is one
of the reasons why ORM technology may be slower at implementing
support for many different databases. Take SQLAlchemy or Django for
instance: each of these technologies must have a different dialect
coded for each database. Using an ORM can make an application more
portable over many different databases. However, as stated in the
preface using zxJDBC would be a fine choice if your application is
only going to target one or two databases.

While using JDBC for Java, one has to deal with the task of finding
and registering a driver for the database. Most of the major
databases make their JDBC drivers readily available for use. Others
may make you register prior to downloading the driver, or in some
cases purchase it. Because zxJDBC is an alternative implementation
of JDBC, one must use a JDBC driver in order to use the API. Most
JDBC drivers come in the format of a JAR file that can be installed
to an application server container, and IDE. In order to make use
of a particular database driver, it must reside within the
CLASSPATH. As mentioned previously, to find a given JDBC driver for
a particular database, take a look at the Sun Microsystems JDBC
Driver search page (http://developers.sun.com/product/jdbc/drivers)
as it contains a listing of different JDBC drivers for *most* of
the databases available today.

.. note::
    
    Examples in this section are for Jython 2.5.1 and later.
    Jython 2.5.1 introduced some simplifications for working with
    connections and cursors. In addition, we assume PostgreSQL for most
    examples, using the world sample database (also available for
    MySQL). In order to follow along with the examples in the following
    sections, you should have a PostgreSQL database available with the
    *world* database example. Please go to the PostgreSQL homepage at
    http://www.postgresql.org to download the database. The world
    database sample is available with the source for this book. It can
    be installed into a PostgreSQL database by opening psql and
    initiating the following command:
    ::
        
        postgres=# \\i <path to world sql>/world.sql

As stated previously, once a driver has been obtained it must be
placed into the classpath. What follows are a few examples for
adding JDBC drivers to the CLASSPATH for a couple of the most
popular databases.

*Listing 12-1. Adding JDBC drivers for popular databases to the CLASSPATH*
::
    
    # Oracle
    # Windows
    set CLASSPATH=<PATH TO JDBC>\\ojdbc14.jar;%CLASSPATH%
    # OS X
    export CLASSPATH=<PATH TO JDBC>/ojdbc14.jar:$CLASSPATH
    # PostgreSQL
    # Windows
    set CLASSPATH=<PATH TO JDBC>\\postgresql-x.x.jdbc4.jar;%CLASSPATH%
    # OS X
    export CLASSPATH=<PATH TO
    JDBC>/postgresql-x.x.jdbc4.jar:$CLASSPATH



After the appropriate JAR file for the target database has been
added to the CLASSPATH, development can commence. It is important
to note that zxJDBC (and all other JDBC implementations) use a
similar procedure for working with the database. One must perform
the following tasks to use a JDBC implementation:

- Create a connection.
- Create a query or statement.
- Obtain results of query or statement.
- If using a query, obtain results in a cursor and iterate over data
to perform tasks.
- Close cursor.
- Close connection (If not using the with_statement syntax in
versions of Jython prior to 2.5.1).

Over the next few sections, we’ll take a look at each of these
steps and how zxJDBC can make them easier than using JDBC
directly.

Connections
-----------

A database connection is simply a resource object that manages
access to the database system. Because database resources are
generally expensive objects to allocate, and can be readily
exhausted, it is important to close them as soon as you're finished
using them. There are two ways to create database connections:

- *Direct creation.* Standalone code, such as a script, will directly
create a connection.

- *JNDI.* Code managed by a container should use JNDI for connection
creation. Such containers include GlassFish, JBoss, Tomcat,
WebLogic, and WebSphere. Normally connections are pooled when run
in this context and are also associated with a given security
context.

The following is an example of the best way to create a database
connection outside of a managed container using Jython 2.5.1. It is
important to note that prior to 2.5.1, the *with_statement* syntax
was not available. This is due to the underlying implementation of
PyConnection in versions of Jython prior to 2.5.1. As a rule, any
object that can be used via the *with_statement* must implement
certain functionality, including the *__exit__* method. Please
see the note that follows to find out how to implement this
functionality in versions prior to 2.5.1. Another thing to notice
is that in order to connect, we must use a JDBC url which conforms
to the standards of a given database in this case, PostgreSQL.

*Listing 12-2*
::
    
    from __future__ import with_statement
    from com.ziclix.python.sql import zxJDBC
    
    # for example
    jdbc_url = "jdbc:postgresql:test"
    username = "postgres"
    password = "jython25"
    driver = "org.postgresql.Driver"
    
    # obtain a connection using the with-statment
    with zxJDBC.connect(jdbc_url, username, password, driver) as conn:
        with conn:
            with conn.cursor() as c:
                c.execute("select name from country")
                c.fetchone()


Walking through the steps, you can see that the *with_statement*
and zxJDBC are imported as we will use them to obtain our
connection. The next step is to define a series of string values
that will be used for the connection activity. Note that these only
need to be defined once if set up as globals. Lastly, the
connection is obtained and some work is done. Now let’s take a look
at this same procedure coded in Java for comparison.

*Listing 12-3.*
::
    
    import java.sql.*;
    import org.postgresql.Driver;
    ...
    // In some method
    Connection conn = null;
    String jdbc_url = "jdbc:postgresql:test";
    String username = "postgres";
    String password = "jython25";
    String driver = "org.postgresql.Driver";
    try {
      DriverManager.registerDriver(new org.postgresql.Driver());
      conn = DriverManager.getConnection(jdbc_url,
                   username, password);
      // do something using statement and resultset
      conn.close();
    } catch(Exception e) {
      logWriter.error("getBeanConnection ERROR: ",e);
    }


.. note::
    
    In versions of Jython prior to 2.5.1, the
    *with_statement* syntax is not available. For this reason, we must
    work directly with the connection (i.e. close it when finished).
    Take a look at the following code for an example of using zxJDBC
    connections without the with_statement functionality.
    
    ::
        
        from __future__ import with_statement from
        com.ziclix.python.sql import zxJDBC
        
        # for example jdbc_url = "jdbc:postgresql:test" username =
        "postgres" password = "jython25" driver = "org.postgresql.Driver"
        
        conn = zxJDBC.connect(jdbc_url, username, password, driver)
        do_something(conn) # Be sure to clean up by closing the connection
        (and cursor) conn.close()

The *with* statement ensures that the connection is immediately
closed following the work. The alternative is to use finally to
perform the close. Using the latter technique allows for more
tightly controlled exception handling technique, but also adds a
considerable amount of code. As noted previously, the with
statement is not available in versions of Jython prior to 2.5.1, so
this is the recommended approach when using those versions:

*Listing 12-4.*
::
    
    try:
        conn = zxJDBC.connect(jdbc_url, username, password, driver)
        do_something(conn)
    finally:
        conn.close()

The connection (PyConnection) object in zxJDBC has a number of
methods and attributes that can be used to perform various
functions and obtain metadata information. For instance, the
*close* method can be used to close the connection. Tables 12-1 and
12-2 are listings of all available methods and attributes for a
connection and what they do.

*Table 12-1:  Connection Methods*


================  ==================================================================================================================================
Method            Functionality
================  ==================================================================================================================================
close             Close the connection now (rather than whenever __del__ is called).
commit            Commits all work that has been performed against a connection
cursor            Returns a new cursor object from the connection
rollback          In case a database does provide transactions this method causes the database to roll back to the start of any pending transaction.
nativesql         Converts the given SQL statement into the system's native SQL grammar
================  ==================================================================================================================================


*Table 12-2:  Connection Attributes*


================  ==================================================================================================================================
Attribute         Functionality
================  ==================================================================================================================================
autocommit        Enable or disable autocommit on a connection.  Default is disabled.
dbname            Returns the name of the database
dbversion         Returns the version of databae
drivername        Returns the database driver name
driverversion     Returns the database driver version
url               Returns the database URL in use
__connection__    Returns the type of connection in use
__cursors__       Returns a listing of all open cursors on the connection
__statements__    Returns a listing of all open statements on the connection
closed            Returns a boolean stating whether connection is closed
================  ==================================================================================================================================



Of course, we can always use the connection to obtain a listing of
all methods and attributes using the syntax shown in Listing 12-5.

*Listing 12-5.*
::
    
    >>> conn.__methods__
    ['close', 'commit', 'cursor', 'rollback', 'nativesql']
    >>> conn.__members__
    ['autocommit', 'dbname', 'dbversion', 'drivername',
    'driverversion', 'url', '__connection__', '__cursors__',
    '__statements__', 'closed']

.. note::
    
    Connection pools help ensure for more robust operation,
    by providing for reuse of connections while ensuring the
    connections are in fact valid. Often naive code will hold a
    connection for a very long time, to avoid the overhead of creating
    a connection, and then go to the trouble of managing reconnecting
    in the event of a network or server failure. It's better to let
    that be managed by the connection pool infrastructure instead of
    reinventing it.

All transactions, if supported, are done within the context of a
connection. We will be discussing transactions further in the
subsection on data modification, but Listing 12-6 is the basic
recipe.

*Listing 12-6. Transaction Recipe*
::
    
    try:
        # Obtain a connection that is not using auto-commit (default for
        zxJDBC)
        conn = zxJDBC.connect(jdbc_url, username, password, driver)
        # Perform all work on connection
        do_something(conn)
        # After all work is complete, commit
        conn.commit()
    except:
        # If a failure occurs along the way, rollback all previous work
        conn.rollback()

ZxJDBC.lookup
-------------

In a managed container, you would use zxJDBC.lookup instead of
zxJDBC.connect. If you have code that needs to run both inside and
outside containers, we recommend you use a factory to abstract
this. Inside a container, like an app server, you should use JDNI
to allocate the resource. Generally the connection will be managed
by a connection pool (see Listing 12-7).

*Listing 12-7.*
::
    
    factory = "com.sun.jndi.fscontext.RefFSContextFactory"
    db = zxJDBC.lookup('jdbc/postgresDS',
        INITIAL_CONTEXT_FACTORY=factory)

This example assumes that the datasource defined in the container
is named “jdbc/postgresDS,” and it uses the Sun FileSystem JNDI
reference implementation. This lookup process does not require
knowing the JDBC URL or the driver factory class. These aspects, as
well as possibly the user name and password, are configured by the
administrator of the container using tools specific to that
container. Most often by convention you will find that JNDI names
typically resemble a *jdbc/NAME* format.

Cursors
~~~~~~~

Once you have a connection, you probably want to do something with
it. Because you can do multiple things within a transaction, such
as query one table, update another, you need one more resource,
which is a cursor. A cursor in zxJDBC is a wrapper around the JDBC
statement and resultSet objects that provides a very *Pythonic*
syntax for working with the database. The result is an easy to use
and extremely flexible API. Cursors are used to hold data that has
been obtained via the database, and they can be used in a variety
of fashions which we will discuss. There are two types of cursors
available for use, static and dynamic. A static cursor is the
default type, and it basically performs an iteration on an entire
resultSet at once. The latter dynamic cursor is known as a lazy
cursor and it only iterates through the resultSet on an as-needed
basis. The following listings are examples of creating each type of
cursor.

*Listing 12-8. Creating all possible cursor types*
::
    
    # Assume that necessary imports have been performed
    # and that a connection has been obtained and assigned
    # to a variable 'conn'
    cursor = conn.cursor() # static cursor creation
    cursor = conn.cursor(True) # dynamic cursor creation with the Boolean argument

Dynamic cursors tend to perform better due to memory constraints;
however, in some cases they are not as convenient as working with a
static cursor. For example, if you’d like to query the database to
find a row count it is very easy with a static cursor because all
rows are obtained at once. This is not possible with a dynamic
cursor and one must perform two queries in order to achieve the
same result.

*Listing 12-9.*
::
    
    # Using a static cursor to obtain rowcount
    >>> cursor = conn.cursor()
    >>> cursor.execute("select * from country")
    >>> cursor.rowcount
    239
    # Using a dynamic cursor to obtain rowcount
    >>> cursor = conn.cursor(1)
    >>> cursor.execute("select * from country")
    >>> cursor.rowcount
    0
    # Since rowcount does not work with dynamic, we must
    # perform a separate count query to obtain information
    >>> cursor.execute("select count(*) from country")
    >>> cursor.fetchone()
    (239L,)


Cursors are used to execute queries, inserts, updates, deletes,
and/or issue database commands. Like connections, cursors have a
number of methods and attributes that can be used to perform
actions or obtain metadata information. See Tables 12-3 and 12-4.

*Table 12-3: Cursor Methods*

*Table 12-4:  Cursor Attributes*

Attribute         Functionality
================  ==================================================================================================================================
arraysize         Number of rows *fetchmany()* should return without any arguments

================  ==================================================================================================================================


A number of the methods and attributes above cannot be used until a
cursor has been executed with a query or statement of some kind.
Most of the time, the particular method or attribute name will
provide a good enough description of its functionality.

Creating and Executing Queries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As you’ve seen previously, it is quite easy to initiate a query
against a given cursor. Simply provide a *sel**ect* statement in
string format as a parameter to the cursor *execute()* or
*executemany()* methods and then use one of the *fetch* methods to
iterate over the returned results. In the following examples we
query the world data and display some cursor data via the
associated attributes and methods.

*Listing 12-10.*
::
    
    >>> cursor = conn.cursor()
    >>> cursor.execute("select country, region from country")
    # Fetch next record
    >>> cursor.fetchone()
    ((AFG,Afghanistan,Asia,"Southern and Central Asia",652090,1919,22720000,45.9,5976.00,,Afganistan/Afqanestan,"Islamic
    Emirate","Mohammad Omar",1,AF), u'Southern and Central Asia')
    # Calling fetchmany() without any parameters returns next record
    >>> cursor.fetchmany()
    [((NLD,Netherlands,Europe,"Western
    Europe",41526,1581,15864000,78.3,371362.00,360478.00,Nederland,"Constitutional
    Monarchy",Beatrix,5,NL), u'Western Europe')]
    # Fetch the next two records
    >>> cursor.fetchmany(2)
    [((ANT,"Netherlands Antilles","North America",Caribbean,800,,217000,74.7,1941.00,,"Nederlandse
    Antillen","Nonmetropolitan Territory of The Netherlands",Beatrix,33,AN), u'Caribbean'),
    ((ALB,Albania,Europe,"Southern
    Europe",28748,1912,3401200,71.6,3205.00,2500.00,Shqip?ria,Republic,"Rexhep Mejdani",34,AL), u'Southern Europe')]
    # Calling fetchall() would retrieve the rest of the records
    >>> cursor.fetchall()
    ...
    # Using description provides data regarding the query in the cursor
    >>> cursor.description
    [('country', 1111, 2147483647, None, None, None, 2), ('region', 12, 2147483647, None, None, None, 0)]

Creating a cursor using the with_statement syntax is easy, please
take a look at the following example for use with Jython 2.5.1 and
beyond.

*Listing 12-11.*
::
    
    with conn.cursor() as c:
        do_some_work(c)

Like connections, you need to ensure the resource is appropriately
closed. So you can just do this to follow the shorter examples we
will look at:

*Listing 12-12.*
::
    
    >>> c = conn.cursor()
    >>> # work with cursor

As you can see, queries are easy to work with using cursors. In the
previous example, we used the *f**etchall()* method to retrieve all
of the results of the query. However, there are other options
available for cases where all results are not desired including the
*fetchone()* and *fetchmany()* options. Sometimes it is best to
iterate over results of a query in order to work with each record
separately. Listing 12-13 iterates over the countries contained
within the country table.

*Listing 12-13.*
::
    
    >>> from com.ziclix.python.sql import zxJDBC
    >>> conn = zxJDBC.connect("jdbc:postgresql:test","postgres","jython25","org.postgresql.Driver")
    >>> cursor = conn.cursor()
    >>> cursor.execute("select name from country")
    >>> while cursor.next():
    ...     print cursor.fetchone()
    ...
    (u'Netherlands Antilles',)
    (u'Algeria',)
    (u'Andorra',)
    ...

Often, queries are not hard-coded, and we need the ability to
substitute values in the query to select the data that our
application requires. Developers also need a way to create dynamic
SQL statements at times. Of course, there are multiple ways to
perform these feats. The easiest way to substitute variables or
create a dynamic query is to simply use string concatenation. After
all, the *execute()* method takes a string-based query. Listing
12-14 shows how to use string concatenation for dynamically forming
a query and also substituting variables.

*Listing 12-14. String Concatenation for Dynamic Query Formation*
::
    
    ...
    # Assume that the user selected a pull-down menu choice determining
    # what results to retrieve from the database, either continent or country name.
    # The selected choice is stored in the selectedChoice variable. Let's also assume
    # that we are interested in all continents or countries beginning with the letter "A"
    >>> qry = "select " + selectedChoice + " from country where " + selectedChoice + " like 'A%'"
    >>> cursor.execute(qry)
    >>> while cursor.next():
    ... print cursor.fetchone()
    ...
    (u'Albania',)
    (u'American Samoa',)
    ...

This technique works very well for creating dynamic queries, but it
also has its share of issues. For instance, reading through
concatenated strings of code can become troublesome on the eyes.
Maintaining such code is a tedious task. Above that, string
concatenation is not the safest way to construct a query as it
opens an application up for a SQL injection attack. SQL injection
is a technique that is used to pass undesirable SQL code into an
application in such a way that it alters a query to perform
unwanted tasks. If the user has the ability to type free text into
a textfield and have that text passed into a string concatenated
query, it is best to perform some other means of filtering to
ensure certain keywords or commenting symbols are not contained in
the value. A better way of getting around these issues is to make
use of prepared statements.

.. note::
    
    Ideally, never construct a query statement directly from
    user data. SQL injection attacks employ such construction as their
    attack vector. Even when not malicious, user data will often
    contain characters, such as quotation marks, that can cause the
    query to fail if not properly escaped. In all cases, it’s important
    to scrub and then escape the user data before it’s used in the
    query.
    
    One other consideration is that such queries will generally consume
    more resources unless the database statement cache is able to match
    it (if at all).
    
    But there are two important exceptions to our recommendation:
    
    *SQL statement requirements: Bind variables cannot be used everywhere. However, specifics will depend on the database.*
    
    *Ad hoc or unrepresentative queries: In databases like Oracle, the statement cache will cache the execution plan, without taking in account lopsided distributions of values that are indexed, but are known to the database if presented literally. In those cases, a more efficient execution plan will result if the value is put in the statement directly.*
    
    However, even in these exceptional cases, it's imperative that any
    user data is fully scrubbed. A good solution is to use some sort of
    mapping table, either an internal dictionary or a mapping table
    driven from the database itself. In certain cases, a carefully
    constructed regular expression may also work. Be careful.

Prepared Statements
-------------------

To get around using the string concatenation technique for
substituting variables, we can use a technique known as
*prepared statements*. Prepared statements allow one to use bind
variables for data substitution, and they are generally safer to
use because most security considerations are taken care of without
developer interaction. However, it is always a good idea to filter
input to help reduce the risk. Prepared statements in zxJDBC work
the same as they do in JDBC, just a simpler syntax. In Listing
12-15, we will perform a query on the country table using a
prepared statement. Note that the question marks are used as place
holders for the substituted variables. It is also important to note
that the *executemany()* method is invoked when using a prepared
statement. Any substitution variables being passed into the
prepared statement must be in the form of a tuple or list.

*Listing 12-15. Using Prepared Statements*
::
    
    ...
    # Passing a string value into the query
    qry = "select continent from country where name = ?"
    >>> cursor.executemany(qry,['Austria'])
    >>> cursor.fetchall()
    [(u'Europe',)]
    
    # Passing some variables into the query
    >>> continent1 = 'Asia'
    >>> continent2 = 'Africa'
    >>> qry = "select name from country where continent in (?,?)"
    >>> cursor.executemany(qry, [continent1, continent2])
    >>> cursor.fetchall()
    [(u'Afghanistan',), (u'Algeria',), (u'Angola',), (u'United Arab Emirates',), (u'Armenia',), (u'Azerbaijan',),
    ...

Resource Management
-------------------

You should always close connections and cursors. This is not only
good practice but absolutely essential in a managed container so as
to avoid exhausting the corresponding connection pool, which needs
the connections returned as soon as they are no longer in use. The
*with* statement makes it easy. See Listing 12-16.

*Listing 12-16. Managing Connections Using With Statements*
::
    
    from __future__ import with_statement
    from itertools import islice
    from com.ziclix.python.sql import zxJDBC
    # externalize
    jdbc_url = "jdbc:oracle:thin:@host:port:sid"
    username = "world"
    password = "world"
    driver = "oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver"
    with zxJDBC.connect(jdbc_url, username, password, driver) as conn:
        with conn:
            with conn.cursor() as c:
                c.execute("select * from emp")
                for row in islice(c, 20):
                    print row # let's redo this w/ namedtuple momentarily...


The older alternative is available. It’s more verbose, and similar
to the Java code that would normally have to be written to ensure
that the resource is closed. See Listing 12-17.

*Listing 12-17. Managing Connections Avoiding the With Statement*
::
    
    try:
        conn = zxJDBC.connect(jdbc_url, username, password, driver)
        cursor = conn.cursor()
        # do something with the cursor
        # Be sure to clean up by closing the connection (and cursor)
    finally:
        if cursor:
            cursor.close()
        if conn:
            conn.close()

Metadata
--------

As mentioned previously in this chapter, it is possible to obtain
metadata information via the use of certain attributes that are
available to both connection and cursor objects. zxJDBC matches
these attributes to the properties that are found in the JDBC
*java.sql.DatabaseMetaData* object. Therefore, when one of these
attributes is called, the JDBC *DatabaseMetaData* object is
actually obtaining the information.

Listing 12-18 shows how to retrieve metadata about a connection,
cursor, or even a specific query. Note that whenever obtaining
metadata about a cursor, you must fetch the data after setting up
the attributes.

*Listing 12-18. Retrieving Metadata About a Connection, Cursor or Specific Query*
::
    
    # Obtain information about the connection using connection attributes
    >>> conn.dbname
    'PostgreSQL'
    >>> conn.dbversion
    '8.4.0'
    >>> conn.drivername
    'PostgreSQL Native Driver'
    # Check for existing cursors
    >>> conn.__cursors__
    [<PyExtendedCursor object instance at 1>]
    
    # Obtain information about the cursor and the query
    >>> cursor = conn.cursor()
    # List all tables
    >>> cursor.tables(None, None, '%', ('TABLE',))
    >>> cursor.fetchall()
    [(None, u'public', u'city', u'TABLE', None), (None, u'public', u'country', u'TABLE', None), (None, u'public', u'countrylanguage',
    u'TABLE', None), (None, u'public', u'test', u'TABLE', None)]

Data Manipulation Language and Data Definition Language
-------------------------------------------------------

Any application that will manipulate data contained in a RDBMS must
be able to issue Data Manipulation Language (DML). Of course, DML
consists of issuing statements such as INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE.
. .the basics of CRUD programming. zxJDBC makes it rather easy to
use DML in a standard cursor object. When doing so, the cursor will
return a value to provide information about the result. A standard
DML transaction in JDBC uses a prepared statement with the cursor
object, and assigns the result to a variable that can be read
afterwards to determine whether the statement succeeded.

ZxJDBC also uses cursors to define new constructs in the database
using Data Definition Language (DDL). Examples of doing such are
creating tables, altering tables, creating indexes, and the like.
Similarly to performing DML with zxJDBC, a resulting DDL statement
returns a value to assist in determining whether the statement
succeeded or not.

In the next couple of examples, we’ll create a table, insert some
values, delete values, and finally delete the table.

*Listing 12-19. Using DML*
::
    
    >>>
    # Create a table named PYTHON_IMPLEMENTATIONS
    >>> stmt = "create table python_implementations (id integer, python_implementation varchar, current_version varchar)"
    >>> result = cursor.execute(stmt)
    >>> print result
    None
    >>> cursor.tables(None, None, '%', ('TABLE',))
    # Ensure table was created
    >>> cursor.fetchall()
    [(None, u'public', u'city', u'TABLE', None), (None, u'public', u'country', u'TABLE', None), (None, u'public', u'countrylanguage',
    u'TABLE', None), (None, u'public', u'python_implementations', u'TABLE', None), (None, u'public', u'test', u'TABLE', None)]
    # Insert some values into the table
    >>> stmt = "insert into PYTHON_IMPLEMENTATIONS values (?, ?, ?)"
    >>> result = cursor.executemany(stmt, [1,'Jython','2.5.1'])
    >>> result = cursor.executemany(stmt, [2,'CPython','3.1.1'])
    >>> result = cursor.executemany(stmt, [3,'IronPython','2.0.2'])
    >>> result = cursor.executemany(stmt, [4,'PyPy','1.1'])
    >>> conn.commit()
    # Query the database
    >>> cursor.execute("select python_implementation, current_version from python_implementations")
    >>> cursor.rowcount
    4
    >>> cursor.fetchall()
    [(u'Jython', u'2.5.1'), (u'CPython', u'3.1.1'), (u'IronPython', u'2.0.2'), (u'PyPy', u'1.1')]
    # Update values and re-query
    >>> stmt = "update python_implementations set
    python_implementation = 'CPython -Standard Implementation' where id = 2"
    >>> result = cursor.execute(stmt)
    >>> print result
    None
    >>> conn.commit()
    >>> cursor.execute("select python_implementation, current_version from python_implementations")
    >>> cursor.fetchall()
    [(u'Jython', u'2.5.1'), (u'IronPython', u'2.0.2'), (u'PyPy', u'1.1'), (u'CPython -Standard Implementation', u'3.1.1')]

It is a good practice to make use of bulk inserts and updates. Each
time a commit is issued it incurs a performance penalty. If DML
statements are grouped together and then followed by a commit, the
resulting transaction will perform much better. Another good reason
to use bulk DML statements is to ensure transactional safety. It is
likely that if one statement in a transaction fails, all others
should be rolled back. As mentioned previously in the chapter,
using a try/except clause will maintain transactional dependencies.
If one statement fails then all others will be rolled back.
Likewise, if they all succeed then they will be committed to the
database with one final commit.

Calling Procedures
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Database applications often make use of procedures and functions
that live inside the database. Most often these procedures are
written in a SQL procedural language such as Oracle’s PL/SQL or
PostgreSQL’s PL/pgSQL. Writing database procedures and using them
with external applications such written in Python, Java, or the
like makes lots of sense, because procedures are often the easiest
way to work with data. Not only are they running close to the metal
since they are in the database, but they also perform much faster
than say a Jython application that needs to connect and close
connections on the database. Since a procedure lives within the
database, there is no performance penalty due to connections being
made.

ZxJDBC can easily invoke a database procedure just as JDBC can do.
This helps developers to create applications that have some of the
more database-centric code residing within the database as
procedures, and other application-specific code running on the
application server and interacting seamlessly with the database. In
order to make a call to a database procedure, zxJDBC offers the
*callproc()* method which takes the name of the procedure to be
invoked. In Listing 12-20, we create a relatively useless procedure
and then call it using Jython (Listing 12-21).

*Listing 12-20. PostgreSQL Procedure*
::
    
    CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION proc_test(
        OUT out_parameter CHAR VARYING(25) )
    AS $$
    DECLARE
    BEGIN
        SELECT python_implementation
        INTO out_parameter
        FROM python_implementations
        WHERE id = 1;
        RETURN;
    END;
    $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

*Listing 12-21. Jython Calling Code*
::
    
    >>> result = cursor.callproc('proc_test')
    >>> cursor.fetchall()
    [(u'Jython',)]

Although this example was relatively trivial, it is easily to see
how the use of database procedures from zxJDBC could easily become
important. Combining database procedures and functions with
application code is a powerful technique, but it does tie an
application to a specific database so it should be used wisely.

Customizing zxJDBC Calls
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At times, it is convenient to have the ability to alter or
manipulate a SQL statement automatically. This can be done before
the statement is sent to the database, after it is sent to the
database, or even just to obtain information about the statement
that has been sent. To manipulate or customize data calls, it is
possible to make use of the *DataHandler* interface that is
available via zxJDBC. There are basically three different methods
for handling type mappings when using DataHandler. They are called
at different times in the process, one when fetching and the other
when binding objects for use in a prepared statement. These
datatype mapping callbacks are categorized into four different
groups: life cycle, developer support, binding prepared statements,
and building results.

At first mention, customizing and manipulating statements can seem
overwhelming and perhaps even a bit daunting. However, the zxJDBC
DataHandler makes this task fairly trivial. Simply create a handler
class and implement the functionality that is required by
overriding a given handler method. What follows is a listing of the
various methods that can be overridden, and we’ll look at a simple
example afterward.

Life Cycle
^^^^^^^^^^

*public void preExecute(Statement stmt)**throws SQLException;*

A callback prior to each execution of the statement. If the
statement is a PreparedStatement (created when parameters are sent
to the execute method), all the parameters will have been set.

*public void postExecute**(Statement stmt) throws SQLException;*

A callback after successfully executing the statement. This is
particularly useful for cases such as auto-incrementing columns
where the statement knows the inserted value.

Developer Support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*public String getMetaDataName**(String name);*

A callback for determining the proper case of a name used in a
DatabaseMetaData method, such as getTables(). This is particularly
useful for Oracle which expects all names to be upper case.

*public PyObject getRowId**(Statement stmt) throws SQLException;*

A callback for returning the row id of the last insert statement.

Binding Prepared Statements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*public Object getJDBCObject**(PyObject object, int type);*

This method is called when a PreparedStatement is created through
use of the execute method. When the parameters are being bound to
the statement, the DataHandler gets a callback to map the type.
*This is only called if type bindings are present.*

*public Object getJDBCObject**(PyObject object);*

This method is called when no type bindings are present during the
execution of a PreparedStatement.

Building Results
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*public PyObject ge**tPyObject(**ResultSet set, int col, int type);*

This method is called upon fetching data from the database. Given
the JDBC type, return the appropriate PyObject subclass from the
Java object at column col in the ResultSet set.

Now we’ll examine a simple example of utilizing this technique. The
recipe basically follows these steps:

1.  Create a handler class to implement a particular functionality  (must implement the DataHandler interface).

2.  Assign the created handler class to a given cursor object.

3.  Use the cursor object to make database calls.

In Listing 12-22, we override the *preExecute* method to print a
message stating that the functionality has been altered. As you can
see, it is quite easy to do and opens up numerous possibilities.

*Listing 12-22. PyHandler.py*
::
    
    from com.ziclix.python.sql import DataHandler
    
    class PyHandler(DataHandler):
        def __init__(self, handler):
            self.handler = handler
            print 'Inside DataHandler'
        def getPyObject(self, set, col, datatype):
            return self.handler.getPyObject(set, col, datatype)
        def getJDBCObject(self, object, datatype):
            print "handling prepared statement"
            return self.handler.getJDBCObject(object, datatype)
        def preExecute(self, stmt):
            print "calling pre-execute to alter behavior"
            return self.handler.preExecute(stmt)

*Jython Interpreter Code*
::
    
    >>> cursor.datahandler = PyHandler(cursor.datahandler)
    Inside DataHandler
    >>> cursor.execute("insert into test values (?,?)", [1,2])
    calling pre-execute

History
-------

zxJDBC was contributed by Brian Zimmer, one-time lead committer for
Jython. This API was written to enable Jython developers to have
the capability of working with databases using techniques that more
closely resembled the Python DB API. The package eventually became
part of the Jython distribution and today it is one of the most
important underlying APIs for working with higher level frameworks
such as Django. The zxJDBC API is evolving at the time of this
publication, and it is likely to become more useful in future
releases.

Object Relational Mapping
=========================

Although zxJDBC certainly offers a viable option for database
access via Jython, there are many other solutions available. Many
developers today are choosing to use ORM (Object Relational
Mapping) solutions to work with the database. This section is not
an introduction to ORM, we assume that you are at least a bit
familiar with the topic. Furthermore, the ORM solutions that are
about to be discussed have an enormous amount of very good
documentation already available either on the web or in book
format. Therefore, this section will give insight on how to use
these technologies with Jython, but it will not go into great
detail on how each ORM solution works. With that said, there is no
doubt in stating that these solutions are all very powerful and
capable for standalone and enterprise applications alike.

In the next couple of sections, we’ll cover how to use some of the
most popular ORM solutions available today with Jython. You’ll
learn how to set up your environment and how to code Jython to work
with each ORM. By the end of this chapter, you should have enough
knowledge to begin working with these ORMs using Jython, and even
start building Jython ORM applications.

SqlAlchemy
----------

No doubt about it, SqlAlchemy is one of the most widely known and
used ORM solutions for the Python programming language. It has been
around long enough that its maturity and stability make it a great
contender for use in your applications. It is simple to setup, and
easy-to-use for both new databases and legacy databases alike. You
can download and install SqlAlchemy and begin using it in a very
short amount of time. The syntax for using this solution is very
straight forward, and as with other ORM technologies, working with
database entities occurs via the use of a mapper that links a
special Jython class to a particular table in the database. The
overall result is that the application persists through the use of
entity classes as opposed to database SQL transactions.

In this section we will cover the installation and configuration of
SqlAlchemy with Jython. The section will then show you how to get
started using it through a few short examples; we will not get into
great detail as there are plenty of excellent references on
SqlAlchemy already. However, this section should fill in the gaps
for making use of this great solution on Jython.

Installation
------------

We’ll begin by downloading SqlAlchemy from the web site
(www.sqlalchemy.org), at the time of this writing the version that
should be used is 0.6. This version has been installed and tested
with the Jython 2.5.0 release. Once you’ve downloaded the package,
unzip it to a directory on your workstation and then traverse to
that directory in your terminal or command prompt. Once you are
inside of your SqlAlchemy directory, issue the following command to
install:

::
    
    jython setup.py install

Once you’ve completed this process, SqlAlchemy should be
successfully installed into your jython Libsite-packages directory.
You can now access the SqlAlchemy modules from Jython, and you can
open up your terminal and check to ensure that the install was a
success by importing sqlalchemy and checking the version. See
Listing 12-23.

*Listing 12-23.*
::
    
    >>> import sqlalchemy
    >>> sqlalchemy.__version__
    '0.6beta1'
    >>>

After we’ve ensured that the installation was a success, it is time
to begin working with SqlAlchemy via the terminal. However, we have
one step left before we can begin. Jython uses zxJDBC to implement
the Python database API in Java. The end result is that most of the
dialects that are available for use with SqlAlchemy will not work
with Jython out of the box. This is because the dialects need to be
rewritten to implement zxJDBC. At the time of this writing, we
could only find one completed dialect, zxoracle, that was rewritten
to use zxJDBC, and we’ll be showing you some examples based upon
zxoracle in the next sections. However, other dialects are in the
works including SQL Server and MySQL. The bad news is that
SqlAlchemy will not yet work with every database available, on the
other hand, Oracle is a very good start and implementing a new
dialect is not very difficult. You can find the zxoracle.py dialect
included in the source for this book. Browse through it and you
will find that it may not be too difficult to implement a similar
dialect for the database of your choice. You can either place
zxoracle somewhere on your Jython path, or place it into the Lib
directory in your Jython installation.

Lastly, we will need to ensure that our database JDBC driver is
somewhere on our path so that Jython can access it. Once you’ve
performed the procedures included in this section, start up Jython
and practice some basic SqlAlchemy using the information from the
next couple of sections.

Using SqlAlchemy
----------------

We can work directly with SqlAlchemy via the terminal or command
line. There is a relatively basic set of steps you’ll need to
follow in order to work with it. First, import the necessary
modules for the tasks you plan to perform. Second, create an engine
to use while accessing your database. Third, create your database
tables if you have not yet done so, and map them to Python classes
using a SqlAlchemy mapper. Lastly, begin to work with the
database.

Now there are a couple of different ways to do things in this
technology, just like any other. For instance, you can either
follow a very granular process for table creation, class creation,
and mapping that involves separate steps for each, or you can use
what is known as a declarative procedure and perform all of these
tasks at the same time. We will show you how to do each of these in
this chapter, along with performing basic database activities using
SqlAlchemy. If you are new to SqlAlchemy, we suggest reading
through this section and then going to sqlalchemy.org and reading
through some of the large library of documentation available there.
However, if you’re already familiar with SqlAlchemy, you can move
on if you wish because the rest of this section is a basic tutorial
of the ORM solution itself.

Our first step is to create an engine that can be used with our
database. Once we’ve got an engine created then we can begin to
perform database tasks making use of it. Type the following lines
of code (Listing 12-24) in your terminal, replacing database
specific information with the details of your development
database.

*Listing 12-24. Creating a Database Engine and Performing Database Tasks*
::
    
    >>> import zxoracle
    >>> from sqlalchemy import create_engine
    >>> db = create_engine('zxoracle://schema:password@hostname:port/database)


Next, we’ll create the metadata that is necessary to create our
database table using SqlAlchemy (Listing 12-25). You can create one
or more tables via metadata, and they are not actually created
until after the metadata is applied to your database engine using a
create_all() call on the metadata. In this example, we are going
to walk you through the creation of a table named Player that will
be used in an application example in the next section.

*Listing 12-25. Creating a Database Table*
::
    
    >>>player = Table('player', metadata,
    ... Column('id', Integer, primary_key=True),
    ... Column('first', String(50)),
    ... Column('last', String(50)),
    ... Column('position', String(30)))
    >>> metadata.create_all(engine)

Our table should now exist in the database and the next step is to
create a Python class to use for accessing this table. See Listing
12-26.

*Listing 12-26. Creating a Python Class to Access a Database Table*
::
    
    class Player(object):
        def __init__(self, first, last, position):
            self.first = first
            self.last = last
            self.position = position
        def __repr__(self):
            return "<Player('%s', '%s', '%s')>" %(self.first, self.last, self.position)


The next step is to create a mapper to correlate the Player python
object and the player database table. To do this, we use the
mapper() function to create a new Mapper object binding the class
and table together (Listing 12-27). The mapper function then stores
the object away for future reference.

*Listing 12-27. Create a Mapper to Correlate the Python Object and the Database Table*
::
    
    >>> from sqlalchemy.orm import mapper
    >>> mapper(Player, player)
    <Mapper at 0x4; Player>



Creating the mapper is the last step in the process of setting up
the environment to work with our table. Now, let’s go back and take
a quick look at performing all of these steps in an easier way. If
we want to create a table, class, and mapper all at once, then we
can do this declaratively. Please note that with the Oracle
dialect, we need to use a sequence to generate the auto-incremented
id column for the table. To do so, import the
sqlalchemy.schema.Sequence object and pass it to the id column when
creating. You must ensure that you’ve manually created this
sequence in your Oracle database or this will not work. See Listing
12-28.

*Listing 12-28. Creating a Table, Class and Mapper at Once*
::
    
    SQL> create sequence id_seq
    2 start with 1
    3 increment by 1;
    
    Sequence created.
    
    # Delarative creation of the table, class, and mapper
    >>> from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base
    >>> from sqlalchemy.schema import Sequence
    >>> Base = declarative_base()
    >>> class Player(object):
    ...     __tablename__ = 'player'
    ...     id = Column(Integer, Sequence(‘id_seq’), primary_key=True)
    ...     first = Column(String(50))
    ...     last = Column(String(50))
    ...     position = Column(String(30))
    ...     def __init__(self, first, last, position):
    ...         self.first = first
    ...         self.last = last
    ...         self.position = position
    ...     def __repr__(self):
    ...         return "<Player('%s','%s','%s')>" % (self.first, self.last, self.position)
    ...

It is time to create a session and begin working with our database.
We must create a session class and bind it to our database engine
that was defined with create_engine­ earlier. Once created, the
Session class will create new session object for our database. The
Session class can also do other things that are out of scope for
this section, but you can read more about them at sqlalchemy.org or
other great references available on the web. See Listing 12-29.

*Listing 12-29. Creating a Session Class*
::
    
    >>> from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker
    >>> Session = sessionmaker(bind=db)


We can start to create Player objects now and save them to our
session. The objects will persist in the database once they are
needed; this is also known as a flush(). If we create the object in
the session and then query for it, SqlAlchemy will first persist
the object to the database and then perform the query. See Listing
12-30.

*Listing 12-30. Creating and Querying the Player Object*
::
    
    #Import sqlalchemy module and zxoracle
    >>> import zxoracle
    >>> from sqlalchemy import create_engine
    >>> from sqlalchemy import Table, Column, String, Integer, MetaData, ForeignKey
    >>> from sqlalchemy.schema import Sequence
    
    # Create engine
    >>> db = create_engine('zxoracle://schema:password@hostname:port/database’)
    # Create metadata and table
    >>> metadata = MetaData()
    >>> player = Table('player', metadata,
    ... Column('id', Integer, Sequence('id_seq'), primary_key=True),
    ... Column('first', String(50)),
    ... Column('last', String(50)),
    ... Column('position', String(30)))

    # Create class to hold table object
    >>> class Player(object):
    ... def __init__(self, first, last, position):
    ... self.first = first
    ... self.last = last

    ... def __repr__(self):
    ... return "<Player('%s','%s','%s')>" % (self.first, self.last, self.position)

    >>> Session = sessionmaker(bind=db)
    >>> session = Session()
    
    # Create player objects, add them to the session
    >>> player1 = Player('Josh', 'Juneau', 'forward')
    >>> player2 = Player('Jim', 'Baker', 'forward')
    >>> player3 = Player('Frank', 'Wierzbicki', 'defense')
    >>> player4 = Player('Leo', 'Soto', 'defense')
    >>> player5 = Player('Vic', 'Ng', 'center')
    >>> session.add(player1)
    >>> session.add(player2)
    >>> session.add(player3)
    >>> session.add(player4)
    >>> session.add(player5)
    
    # Query the objects
    >>> forwards = session.query(Player).filter_by(position='forward').all()
    >>> forwards
    [<Player('Josh','Juneau','forward')>, <Player('Jim','Baker','forward')>]
    >>> defensemen = session.query(Player).filter_by(position='defense').all()
    >>> defensemen
    [<Player('Frank','Wierzbicki','defense')>, <Player('Leo','Soto','defense')>]
    >>> center = session.query(Player).filter_by(position='center').all()
    >>> center
    [<Player('Vic','Ng','center')>]



Well, hopefully from this example you can see the benefits of using
SqlAlchemy. Of course, you can perform all of the necessary SQL
actions such as insert, update, select, and delete against the
objects. However, as said before, there are many very good
tutorials where you can learn how to do these things. We’ve barely
scratched the surface of what you can do with SqlAlchemy, it is a
very powerful tool to add to any Jython or Python developer’s
arsenal.

Hibernate
---------

Hibernate is a very popular object relational mapping solution used
in the Java world. As a matter of fact, it is so popular that many
other ORM solutions are either making use of Hibernate or extending
it in various ways. As Jython developers, we can make use of
Hibernate to create powerful hybrid applications. Because Hibernate
works by mapping POJO (plain old Java object) classes to database
tables, we cannot map our Jython objects to it directly. While we
could always try to make use of an object factory to coerce our
Jython objects into a format that Hibernate could use, this
approach leaves a bit to be desired. Therefore, if you wish to
create an application coded entirely using Jython, this would
probably not be the best ORM solution. However, most Jython
developers are used to doing a bit of work in Java and as such,
they can harness the maturity and power of the Hibernate API to
create first-class hybrid applications. This section will show you
how to create database persistence objects using Hibernate and
Java, and then use them directly from a Jython application. The end
result, code the entity POJOs in Java, place them into a JAR file
along with Hibernate and all required mapping documents, and then
import the JAR into your Jython application and use.

We have found that the easiest way to create such an application is
to make use of an IDE such as Eclipse or Netbeans. Then create two
separate projects, one of the projects would be a pure Java
application that will include the entity beans. The other project
would be a pure Jython application that would include everything
else. In this situation, you could simply add resulting JAR from
your Java project into the sys.path of your Jython project and
you’ll be ready to go. However, this works just as well if you do
not wish to use an IDE.

It is important to note that this section will provide you with one
use case for using Jython, Java, and Hibernate together. There may
be many other scenarios in which this combination of technologies
would work out just as well, if not better. It is also good to note
that this section will not cover Hibernate in any great depth;
we’ll just scratch the surface of what it is capable of doing.
There are a plethora of great Hibernate tutorials available on the
web if you find this solution to be useful.

Entity Classes and Hibernate Configuration
------------------------------------------

Because our Hibernate entity beans must be coded in Java, most of
the Hibernate configuration will reside in your Java project.
Hibernate works in a straightforward manner. You basically map a
table to a POJO and use a configuration file to map the two
together. It is also possible to use annotations as opposed to XML
configuration files, but for the purposes of this use case we will
show you how to use the configuration files.

The first configuration file we need to assemble is the
hibernate.cfg.xml, which you can find in the root of your Java
project directory tree. The purpose of this file is to define your
database connection information as well as declare which entity
configuration files will be used in your project. For the purposes
of this example, we will be using the PostgreSql database, and
we’ll be using the classic examples of the hockey roster
application. This makes for a very simple use-case as we only deal
with one table here, the Player table. Hibernate makes it very
possible to work with multiple tables and even associate them in
various ways.

*Listing 12-31.*
::
    
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <!DOCTYPE hibernate-configuration PUBLIC "-//Hibernate/Hibernate
    Configuration DTD 3.0//EN"
    "http://hibernate.sourceforge.net/hibernate-configuration-3.0.dtd">
    <hibernate-configuration>
    <session-factory>
        <!-- Database connection settings -->
        <property
        name="connection.driver_class">org.postgresql.Driver</property>
        <property
        name="connection.url">jdbc:postgresql://localhost/database-name</property>
        <property name="connection.username">username</property>
        <property name="connection.password">password</property>
        <!-- JDBC connection pool (use the built-in) -->
        <property name="connection.pool_size">1</property>
        <!-- SQL dialect -->
        <property
        name="dialect">org.hibernate.dialect.PostgreSQLDialect</property>
        <mapping resource="org/jythonbook/entity/Player.hbm.xml"/>
    </session-factory>
    </hibernate-configuration>

Our next step is to code the plain old Java object for our database
table. In this case, we’ll code an object named Player that
contains only four database columns: id, first, last, and position.
As you’ll see, we use standard public accessor methods with private
variables in this class.

*Listing 12-32.*
::
    
    package org.jythonbook.entity;
    
    public class Player {
    
        public Player(){}
        
        private long id;
        private String first;
        private String last;
        private String position;
        
        public long getId(){
            return this.id;
        }
        private void setId(long id){
            this.id = id;
        }
        public String getFirst(){
            return this.first;
        }
        public void setFirst(String first){
            this.first = first;
        }
        public String getLast(){
            return this.last;
        }
        public void setLast(String last){
            this.last = last;
        }
        public String getPosition(){
            return this.position;
        }
        public void setPosition(String position){
            this.position = position;
        }
    }

Lastly, we will create a configuration file that will be used by
Hibernate to map our POJO to the database table itself. We’ll
ensure that the primary key value is always populated by using a
generator class type of increment. Hibernate also allows for the
use of other generators, including sequences if desired. The
player.hbm.xml file should go into the same package as our POJO, in
this case, the org.jythonbook.entity package.

*Listing 12-33. Creating a Hibernate Configuration File*
::
    
    <?xml version="1.0"?>
    <!DOCTYPE hibernate-mapping PUBLIC
    "-//Hibernate/Hibernate Mapping DTD 3.0//EN"
    "http://hibernate.sourceforge.net/hibernate-mapping-3.0.dtd">
    <hibernate-mapping package="org.jythonbook.entity">
        <class name="Player" table="player" lazy="true">
            <comment>Player for Hockey Team</comment>
            <id name="id" column="id">
                <generator class="increment"/>
            </id>
            <property name="first" column="first"/>
            <property name="last" column="last"/>
            <property name="position" column="position"/>
        </class>
    </hibernate-mapping>



That is all we have to do inside of the Java project for our simple
example. Of course, you can add as many entity classes as you’d
like to your own project. The main point to remember is that all of
the entity classes are coded in Java, and we will code the rest of
the application in Jython.

Jython Implementation Using the Java Entity Classes
---------------------------------------------------

The remainder of our use-case will be coded in Jython. Although all
of the Hibernate configuration files and entity classes are coded
and place within the Java project, we’ll need to import that
project into the Jython project, and also import the Hibernate JAR
file so that we can make use of its database session and
transactional utilities to work with the entities. In the case of
Netbeans, you’d create a Python application then set the Python
platform to Jython 2.5.0. After that, you should add all of the
required Hibernate JAR files as well as the Java project JAR file
to the Python path from within the project properties. Once you’ve
set up the project and taken care of the dependencies, you’re ready
to code the implementation.

As said previously, for this example we are coding a hockey roster
implementation. The application runs on the command line and
basically allows one to add players to a roster, remove players,
and check the current roster. All of the database transactions will
make use of the Player entity we coded in our Java application, and
we’ll make use of Hibernate’s transaction management from within
our Jython code.

            print "Hockey Roster Application\\n\\n"
            hockey = HockeyRoster()
            hockey.make_selection()


We begin our implementation in the main block, where the
HockeyRoster class is instantiated. As you can see, the hibernate
configuration is initialized and the session factory is built
within the class initializer. Next, the make_selection() method is
invoked which begins the actual execution of the program. The
entire Hibernate configuration resides within the Java project, so
we are not working with XML here, just making use of it. The code
then begins to branch so that various tasks can be performed. In
the case of adding a player to the roster, a user could enter the
number 1 at the command prompt. You can see that the addPlayer()
function simply creates a new Player object, populates it, and
saves it into the database. Likewise, the searchRoster() function
calls another function named returnPlayerList() which queries the
player table using Hibernate query language and returns a list of
Player objects.

In the end, we have a completely scalable solution. We can code our
entities using a mature and widely used Java ORM solution, and then
implement the rest of the application in Jython. This allows us to
make use of the best features of the Python language, but at the
same time, persist our data using Java.

Summary
=======

You would be hard-pressed to find too many enterprise-level
applications today that do not make use of a relational database in
one form or another. The majority of applications in use today use
databases to store information as they help to provide robust
solutions. That being said, the topics covered in this chapter are
very important to any developer. In this chapter, we learned that
there are many different ways to implement database applications in
Jython, specifically through the Java database connectivity API or
an object relational mapping solution.
