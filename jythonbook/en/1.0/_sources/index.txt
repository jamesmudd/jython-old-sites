Foreword
========

I started using Python in 2003, and I fell in love with the language for a variety of reasons. The elegance
of Python’s whitespace based syntax, the well conceived built in data types, and a beautiful set of library
functions. Since that time, many other people have discovered or rediscovered Python. At the time of
this writing, the software industry is well into a resurgence of dynamically typed languages: Ruby, PHP,
and Python.
It wasn’t until I attended my first PyCon in 2004 that I became aware of Jython. People were glad of
the ability to run Python programs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), but were wistful because at the
time Jython was lagging behind the native C Python (CPython) interpreter in terms of supporting recent
versions of the language. Jython was maintained by a series of individual developers, but the task of
staying current with CPython was really too much for any single person. In December 2005, Frank
Wierzbicki took over as the lead developer for Jython, and over the next few years managed to foster a
community of developers for Jython. The authors of this book are some of the members of that
community. In June of 2009, the Jython community released Jython 2.5, which implemented the same
language as CPython 2.5. This was a major leap forward, bringing Jython much closer to feature parity
with CPython, and laying a foundation for catching up the rest of the way with CPython. Jython 2.5 is
able to run many of the most popular Python packages, including Django, Pylons, and SQLAlchemy.
Jython makes for a best of both worlds bridge between the elegant, expressive code of the Python
world and the “enterprise ready” Java world. Developers who work in organizations where Java is
already in use can now take advantage of the expressiveness and conciseness of Python by running their
Python programs on Jython. Jython provides easy integration and interoperability between Python code
and existing Java code.
Jython also has something to offer existing Python programmers, namely access to the very rich
ecosystem of the Java Virtual Machine. There is an enormous amount of Java code out in the world.
There are libraries for every task imaginable, and more. Jython gives Python programmers a way to tap
into these libraries, saving both development and testing time. Web applications running on Jython can
also take advantage of the scalability benefits of Java web containers such as Tomcat or GlassFish.
Things are looking very bright for Jython, and this book is a timely resource for people interested in
taking advantage of the benefits that Jython has to offer.
