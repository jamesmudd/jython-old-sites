Chapter 2:  Data Types and Referencing
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Programming languages and applications need data. We define applications to work with
data, and we need to have containers that can be used to hold it. This chapter is all
about defining containers and using them to work with application data. Whether the
data we are using is coming from a keyboard entry or if we are working with a
database, there needs to be a way to temporarily store it in our programs so that it
can be manipulated and used. Once we're done working with the data then these
temporary containers can be destroyed in order to make room for new constructs.

We’ll start by taking a look at the different data types that are offered by the
Python language, and then we'll follow by discussing how to use that data once it has
been collected and stored. We will compare and contrast the different types of
structures that we have in our arsenal, and we’ll give some examples of which
structures to use for working with different types of data. There are a multitude of
tasks that can be accomplished through the use of lists, dictionaries, and tuples and
we will try to cover many of them. Once you learn how to define and use these
structures, then we’ll talk a bit about what happens to them once they are no longer
needed by our application.

Let’s begin our journey into exploring data types and structures within the Python
programming language. . .these are skills that you will use in each and every
practical Jython program.

Python Data Types
=================

As we’ve discussed, there is a need to store and manipulate data within programs. In
order to do so then we must also have the ability to create containers used to hold
that data so that the program can use it. The language needs to know how to handle
data once it is stored, and we can do that by assigning data type to our containers
in Java. However, in Python it is not a requirement to do so because the interpreter
is able to determine which type of data we are storing in a dynamic fashion.

Table 2-1 lists each data type and gives a brief description of the characteristics
that define each of them.

+--------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+


Given all of that information and the example above, we should officially discuss how
to declare a variable in the Python language. Let’s take a look at some examples of
defining variables in the following lines of code.

*Listing 2-1. Defining Variables in Jython*
::
        
    # Defining a String
    
    x = 'Hello World'
    
    x = "Hello World Two"
    
    #  Defining an integer
    
    y = 10
    
    #  Float
    
    z = 8.75
    
    # Complex
    
    i = 1 + 8.07j

An important point to note is that there really are no types in Jython. Every object
is an instance of a class. In order to find the type of an object, simply use the
type() function.

*Listing 2-2.*
::
    
    # Return the type of an object using the type function
    
    >>> i = 1 + 8.07j
    
    >>> type(i)
    
    <type 'complex'>
    
    >>> a = 'Hello'
    
    >>> type(a)
    
    <type 'str'>

A nice feature to note is multiple assignment. Quite often it is necessary to assign
a number of values to different variables. Using multiple assignment in Python, it is
possible to do this in one line.

*Listing 2-3. Multiple Assignment*
::
    
    >>> x, y, z = 1, 2, 3
    
    >>> print x
    
    1
    
    >>> print z
    
    3
    
    >>>

Strings and String Methods
==========================

Strings are a special type within most programming languages because they are often
used to manipulate data. A string in Python is a sequence of characters, which is
immutable. An immutable object is one that cannot be changed after it is created. The
opposite would be a mutable object, which can be altered after creation. This is very
important to know as it has a large impact on the overall understanding of strings.
However, there are quite a few string methods that can be used to manipulate the
contents of a particular string. We never actually manipulate the contents though,
these methods return a manipulated copy of the string. The original string is left
unchanged.

Prior to the release of Jython 2.5.0, CPython and Jython treated strings a bit
differently. There are two types of string objects in CPython, these are known as
Standard strings and Unicode strings. There is a lot of documentation available that
specifically focuses on the differences between the two types of strings, this
reference will only cover the basics. It is worth noting that Python contains an
abstract string type known as basestring so that it is possible to check any type of
string to ensure that it is a string instance.

Prior to the release of Jython 2.5.0 there was only one string type. The string type
in Jython supported full two-byte Unicode characters and all functions contained in
the string module were Unicode-aware. If the u'' string modifier is specified, it is
ignored by Jython. Since the release of 2.5.0, strings in Jython are treated just
like those in CPython, so the same rules will apply to both implementations. If you
are interested in learning more about String encoding, there are many great
references available on the topic. It is also worth noting that Jython uses character
methods from the Java platform. Therefore properties such as isupper and islower,
which we will discuss later in the section, are based upon the Java methods, although
they actually work the same way as their CPython counterparts

In the remainder of this section, we will go through each of the many string
functions that are at our disposal. These functions will work on both Standard and
Unicode strings. As with many of the other features in Python and other programming
languages, at times there is more than one way to accomplish a task. In the case of
strings and string manipulation, this holds true. However, you will find that in most
cases, although there are more than one way to do things, Python experts have added
functions which allow us to achieve better performing and easier to read code.

Table 2-2 lists all of the string methods that have been built into the Python
language as of the 2.5 release. Because Python is an evolving language, this list is
sure to change in future releases. Most often, additions to the language will be
made, or existing features are enhanced. Following the table, we will give numerous
examples of the methods and how they are used. Although we cannot provide an example
of how each of these methods work (that would be a book in itself), they all function
in the same manner so it should be rather easy to pick up.

Now let’s take a look at some examples so that you get an idea of how to use the
string methods. As stated previously, most of them work in a similar manner.

    ['He', '', 'o, my name is Josh']
    
    # As you can see, the tuple returned does not contain the separator value
    
    # Now if we add maxsplits value of 1, you can see that the right-most split is
    
    # taken.  If we specify maxsplits value of 2, the two right-most splits are taken
    
    >>> x.split('l',1)
    
    ['He', 'lo, my name is Josh']
    
    >>> x.split('l',2)
    
    ['He', '', 'o, my name is Josh']

String Formatting
-----------------

You have many options when printing strings using the print statement. Much like the
C programming language, Python string formatting allows you to make use of a number
of different conversion types when printing.

*Listing 2-5. Using String Formatting*
::
    
    # The two syntaxes below work the same
    
    >>> x = "Josh"
    
    >>> print "My name is %s" % (x)
    
    My name is Josh
    
    >>> print "My name is %s" % x
    
    My name is Josh
    
    # An example using more than one argument
    
    >>> name = 'Josh'
    
    >>> language = 'Python'
    
    >>> print "My name is %s and I speak %s" % (name, language)
    
    My name is Josh and I speak Python
    
    # And now for some fun, here's a different conversion type
    
    # Mind you, I'm not sure where in the world the temperature would
    
    # fluctuate so much!
    
    >>> day1_temp = 65
    
    >>> day2_temp = 68
    
    >>> day3_temp = 84
    
    >>> print "Given the temparatures %d, %d, and %d, the average would be %f" %
    (day1_temp, day2_temp, day3_temp, (day1_temp + day2_temp + day3_temp)/3)
    
    Given the temperatures 65, 68, and 83, the average would be 72.333333

Lists, Dictionaries, Sets, and Tuples
=====================================

Lists, dictionaries, sets, and tuples all offer similar functionality and usability,
but they each have their own niche in the language. We’ll go through several examples
of each since they all play an important role under certain circumstances. Unlike
strings, all of the containers discussed in this section (except tuples) are mutable
objects, so they can be manipulated after they have been created.

Because these containers are so important, we’ll go through an exercise at the end of
this chapter, which will give you a chance to try them out for yourself.

Lists
-----

Perhaps one of the most used constructs within the Python programming language is the
list. Most other programming languages provide similar containers for storing and
manipulating data within an application. The Python list provides an advantage over
those similar constructs that are available in statically typed languages. The
dynamic tendencies of the Python language help the list construct to harness the
great feature of having the ability to contain values of different types. This means
that a list can be used to store any Python data type, and these types can be mixed
within a single list. In other languages, this type of construct is often defined as
a typed object, which locks the construct to using only one data type.

The creation and usage of Python lists is just the same as the rest of the language.
. .very simple and easy to use. Simply assigning a set of empty square brackets to a
variable creates an empty list. We can also use the built-in list() function to
create a list. The list can be constructed and modified as the application runs, they
are not declared with a static length. They are easy to traverse through the usage of
loops, and indexes can also be used for positional placement or removal of particular
items in the list. We’ll start out by showing some examples of defining lists, and
then go through each of the different avenues which the Python language provides us
for working with lists.

*Listing 2-7. Defining Lists*
::
    
    # Define an empty list
    
    my_list = []
    
    my_list = list()  # rarely used
    
    # Single Item List
    
    >>> my_list = [1]
    
    >>> my_list           # note that there is no need to use print to display a variable
    in the
    
    >>> # interpreter
    
    [1]
    
    # Define a list of string values
    
    my_string_list = ['Hello', 'Jython' ,'Lists']
    
    # Define a list containing mulitple data types
    
    multi_list = [1, 2, 'three', 4, 'five', 'six']
    
    # Define a list containing a list
    
    combo_list = [1, my_string_list, multi_list]
    
    # Define a list containing a list inline
    
    >>> my_new_list = ['new_item1', 'new_item2', [1, 2, 3, 4], 'new_item3']
    
    >>> print my_new_list
    
    ['new_item1', 'new_item2', [1, 2, 3, 4], 'new_item3']

As stated previously, in order to obtain the values from a list we can make use of
indexes. Much like the Array in the Java language, using the list[index] notation
will allow us to access an item. If we wish to obtain a range or set of values from a
list, we can provide a starting index, and/or an ending index. This technique is also
known as slicing. What’s more, we can also return a set of values from the list along
with a stepping pattern by providing a step index as well. One key to remember is
that while accessing a list via indexing, the first element in the list is contained
within the 0 index. Note that when slicing a list, a new list is always returned. One
way to create a shallow copy of a list is to use slice notation without specifying an
upper or lower bound. The lower bound defaults to zero, and the upper bound defaults
to the length of the list.

Note that a shallow copy constructs a new compound object (list or other object
containing objects) and then inserts references into it to the original objects. A
deep copy constructs a new compound object and then inserts copies into it based upon
the objects found in the original.

*Listing 2-8. Accessing a List*
::
    
    # Obtain elements in the list
    
    >>> my_string_list[0]
    
    'Hello'
    
    >>> my_string_list[2]
    
    'Lists'
    
    # Negative indexes start with the last element in the list and work back towards the
    first
    
    # item
    
    >>> my_string_list[-1]
    
    'Lists'
    
    >>> my_string_list[-2]
    
    'Jython'
    
    # Using slicing (Note that slice includes element at starting index and excludes the
    end)
    
    >>> my_string_list[0:2]
    
    ['Hello', 'Jython']
    
    # Create a shallow copy of a list using slice
    
    >>> my_string_list_copy = my_string_list[:]
    
    >>> my_string_list_copy
    
    ['Hello', 'Jython', 'Lists']
    
    # Return every other element in a list
    
    >>> new_list=[2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20]
    
    # Using a third parameter in the slice will cause a stepping action to take place
    
    # In this example we step by one
    
    >>> new_list[0:10:1]
    
    [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20]
    
    # And here we step by two
    
    >>> new_list[0:10:2]
    
    [2, 6, 10, 14, 18]
    
    # Leaving a positional index blank will also work as the default is 0 for the start,
    and the length of the string for the end.
    
    >>> new_list[::2]
    
    [2, 6, 10, 14, 18]

Modifying a list is much the same, you can  use the index in order to insert or
remove items from a particular position. There are also many other ways that you can
insert or remove elements from the list. Python provides each of these different
options as they provide different functionality for your operations.

*Listing 2-9.*
::
    
    # Modify an element in a list.  In this case we'll modify the element in the 9th
    position
    
    >>> new_list[9] = 25
    
    >>> new_list
    
    [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 25]

You can make use of the append() method in order to add an item to the end of a list.
The extend() method allows you to add copy of  an entire list or sequence to the end
of a list. Lastly, the insert() method allows you to place an item or another list
into a particular position of an existing list by utilizing positional indexes. If
another list is inserted into an existing list then it is not combined with the
original list, but rather it acts as a separate item contained within the original
list. You will find examples of each method below.

Similarly, we have plenty of options for removing items from a list. The del
statement, as explained in Chapter 1, can be used to remove or delete an entire list
or values from a list using the index notation. You can also use the pop() or
remove() method to remove single values from a list. The pop() method will remove a
single value from the end of the list, and it will also return that value at the same
time. If an index is provided to the pop() function, then it will remove and return
the value at that index. The remove() method can be used to find and remove a
particular value in the list. In other words, remove() will delete the first matching
element from the list. If more than one value in the list matches the value passed
into the remove() function, the first one will be removed. Another note about the
remove() function is that the value removed is not returned. Let’s take a look at
these examples of modifying a list.

*Listing 2-10. Modifying a List*
::
    
    # Adding values to a list using the append method
    
    >>> new_list=['a','b','c','d','e','f','g']
    
    >>> new_list.append('h')
    
    >>> print new_list
    
    ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h']
    
    # Add another list to the existing list
    
    >>> new_list2=['h','i','j','k','l','m','n','o','p']
    
    >>> new_list.extend(new_list2)
    
    >>> print new_list
    
    ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', ‘h’,'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'o', 'p']
    
    # Insert a value into a particular location via the index.
    
    # In this example, we add a 'c' into the third position in the list
    
    # (Remember that list indicies start with 0, so the second index is actually the
    third
    
    # position)
    
    >>> new_list.insert(2,'c')
    
    >>> print new_list
    
    ['a', 'b', 'c', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', ‘h’,'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'o',
    'p']
    
    # Insert a list into a particular postion via the index
    
    >>> another_list = ['a', 'b', 'c']
    
    >>> another_list.insert(2, new_list)
    
    >>> another_list
    
    ['a', 'b', [2, 4, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 25], 'c']
    
    # Use the slice notation to overwrite part of a list or sequence
    
    >>> new_listA=[100,200,300,400]
    
    >>> new_listB=[500,600,700,800]
    
    >>> new_listA[0:2]=new_listB
    
    >>> print new_listA
    
    [500, 600, 700, 800, 300, 400]
    
    # Assign a list to another list using the empty slice notation
    
    >>> one = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
    
    >>> two = ['e', 'f']
    
    >>> one
    
    ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
    
    >>> two
    
    ['e', 'f']
    
    # Obtain an empty slice from a list by using the same start and end position.
    
    # Any start and end position will work, as long as they are the same number.
    
    >>> one[2:2]
    
    []
    
    # In itself, this is not very interesting – you could have made an empty list
    
    # very easily. The useful thing about this is that you can assign to this empty slice
    
    # Now, assign the 'two' list to an empty slice for the 'one' list which essentially
    
    # inserts the 'two' list into the 'one' list
    
    >>> one[2:2] = two          # the empty list between elements 1 and 2 of list 'one'
    is
    
    >>>              # replaced by the list 'two'
    
    >>> one
    
    ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f']
    
    # Use the del statement to remove a value or range of values from a list
    
    # Note that all other elements are shifted to fill the empty space

Now that we know how to add and remove items from a list, it is time to learn how to
manipulate the data within them. Python provides a number of different methods that
can be used to help us manage our lists. See Table 2-4 for a list of these functions
and what they can do.

+-------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|index  |Returns the index of the first value in the list which matches a given     |
|       |value.                                                                     |
+-------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|count  |Returns the number of items in the list which equal a given value.         |
+-------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|sort   |Sorts the items contained within the list and returns the list             |
+-------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|reverse|Reverses the order of the items contained within the list, and returns the |
|       |list                                                                       |

Let’s take a look at some examples of how these functions can be used on lists.

    #  Change the value of the element at index 4
    
    >>> new_list[4] = 30

Traversing and Searching Lists
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Moving around within a list is quite simple. Once a list is populated, often times we
wish to traverse through it and perform some action against each element contained
within it. You can use any of the Python looping constructs to traverse through each
element within a list. While there are plenty of options available, the for loop
works especially well. This is because of the simple syntax that the Python for loop
uses. This section will show you how to traverse a list using each of the different
Python looping constructs. You will see that each of them has advantages and
disadvantages.

Let’s first take a look at the syntax that is used to traverse a list using a for
loop. This is by far one of the easiest modes of going through each of the values
contained within a list. The for loop traverses the list one element at a time,
allowing the developer to perform some action on each element if so desired.

*Listing 2-12. Traversing a List Using a ‘for’ Loop*
::
    
    >>> ourList=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
    
    >>> for elem in ourList:
    
    ...    print elem
    
    ...
    
    1
    
    2
    
    3
    
    4
    
    5
    
    6
    
    7
    
    8

    10

As you can see from this simple example, it is quite easy to go through a list and
work with each item individually. The for loop syntax requires a variable to which
each element in the list will be assigned for each pass of the loop.

It is also possible to combine slicing with the use of the for loop. In this case,
we’ll simply use a list slice to retrieve the exact elements we want to see. For
instance, take a look a the following code which traverses through the first 5
elements in our list.

*Listing 2-13.*
::
    
    >>> for elem in ourList[:5]:
    
    ...     print elem
    
    ...
    
    1
    
    2
    
    3
    
    4
    
    5

As you can see, doing so is quite easy by simply making use of the built-in features
that Python offers.

List Comprehensions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As we've seen in the previous section, we can create a copy of a list using the
slicing. Another more powerful way to do so is via the list comprehension. There are
some advanced features for lists that can help to make a developer’s life easier. One
such feature is known as a list comprehension. While this concept may be daunting at
first, it offers a good alternative to creating many separate lists manually. List
comprehensions take a given list, and then iterate through it and apply a given
expression against each of the objects in the list.

*Listing 2-14. Simple List Comprehension*
::
    
    # Multiply each number in a list by 2 using a list comprehension
    
    # Note that list comprehension returns a new list
    
    >>> num_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]
    
    >>> [num * 2 for num in num_list]
    
    [2, 4, 6, 8]
    
    # We could assign a list comprehension to a variable
    
    >>> num_list2 = [num * 2 for num in num_list]
    
    >>> num_list2
    
    [2, 4, 6, 8]

As you can see, this allows one to quickly take a list and alter it via the use of
the provided expression. Of course, as with many other Python methods the list
comprehension returns an altered copy of the list. The list comprehension produces a
new list and the original list is left untouched.

Let’s take a look at the syntax for a list comprehension. They are basically
comprised of an expression of some kind followed by a for statement and then
optionally more for or if statements. The basic functionality of a list comprehension
is to iterate over the items of a list, and then apply some expression against each
of the list’s members. Syntactically, a list comprehension reads as follows:

Iterate through a list and optionally perform an expression on each element, then
either return a new list containing the resulting elements or evaluate each element
given an optional clause.

::
    
    [list-element (optional expression) for list-element in list (optional clause)]

*Listing 2-15. Using an If Clause in a List Comprehension*
::
    
    # The following example returns each element
    
    # in the list that is greater than the number 4
    
    >>> nums = [2, 4, 6, 8]
    
    >>> [num for num in nums if num > 4]
    
    [6, 8]

Let’s take a look at some more examples. Once you’ve seen list comprehensions in
action you are sure to understand them and see how useful they can be.

*Listing 2-16. Python List Comprehensions*
::
    
    # Create a list of ages and add one to each of those ages using a list comprehension
    
    >>> ages=[20,25,28,30]
    
    >>> [age+1 for age in ages]
    
    [21, 26, 29, 31]
    
    # Create a list of names and convert the first letter of each name to uppercase as it
    should be
    
    >>> names=['jim','frank','vic','leo','josh']
    
    >>> [name.title() for name in names]
    
    ['Jim', 'Frank', 'Vic', 'Leo', 'Josh']
    
    # Create a list of numbers and return the square of each EVEN number
    
    >>> numList=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12]
    
    >>> [num*num for num in numList if num % 2 == 0]
    
    [4, 16, 36, 64, 100, 144]
    
    # Use a list comprehension with a range
    
    >>> [x*5 for x in range(1,20)]
    
    [5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95]
    
    # Use a for clause to perform calculations against elements of two different lists
    
    >>> list1 = [5, 10, 15]
    
    >>> list2 = [2, 4, 6]
    
    >>> [e1 + e2 for e1 in list1 for e2 in list2]
    
    [7, 9, 11, 12, 14, 16, 17, 19, 21]

List comprehensions can make code much more concise and allows one to apply
expressions or functions to list elements quite easily. Let’s take a quick look at an
example written in Java for performing the same type of work as an list
comprehension. It is plain to see that list comprehensions are much more concise.

*Listing 2-17. Java Code to Take a List of Ages and Add One Year to Each Age*
::
    
    int[] ages = {20, 25, 28, 30};
    
    int[] ages2 = new int[ages.length];
    
    // Use a  Java for loop to go through each element in the array
    
    for (int x = 0; x <= ages.length; x++){
    
    ;
    
    ages2[x] = ages[x]+1;
    
    }

Tuples
------

Tuples are much like lists; however, they are immutable. Once a tuple has been
defined, it cannot be changed. They contain indexes just like lists, but again, they
cannot be altered once defined. Therefore, the index in a tuple may be used to
retrieve a particular value and not to assign or modify. While tuples may appear
similar to lists, they are quite different in that tuples usually contain
heterogeneous elements, whereas lists oftentimes contain elements that are related in
some way. For instance, a common use case for tuples is to pass parameters to a
function, method, and so on.

Since tuples are a member of the sequence type, they can use the same set of methods
an operations available to all sequence types.

*Listing 2-18. Examples of Tuples*
::
    
    # Creating an empty tuple
    
    >>> myTuple = ()
    
    # Creating tuples and using them
    
    >>> myTuple2 = (1, 'two',3, 'four')
    
    >>> myTuple2
    
    (1, 'two', 3, 'four')
    
    # To create a single-item tuple, include a trailing comma
    
    >>> myteam = 'Bears',
    
    >>> myteam
    
    ('Bears',)

As mentioned previously, tuples can be quite useful for passing to functions,
methods, classes, and so on. Oftentimes, it is nice to have an immutable object for
passing multiple values. One such case would be using a tuple to pass coordinates in
a geographical information system or another application of the kind. They are also
nice to use in situations where an immutable object is warranted. Because they are
immutable, their size does not grow once they have been defined, so tuples can also
play an important role when memory allocation is a concern.

Dictionaries
------------

A Python dictionary is a key-value store container. A dictionary is quite different
than a typical list in Python as there is no automatically populated index for any
given element within the dictionary. When you use a list, you need not worry about
assigning an index to any value that is placed within it. A dictionary allows the
developer to assign an index or “key” for every element that is placed into the
construct. Therefore, each entry into a dictionary requires two values, the key and
the element.

The beauty of the dictionary is that it allows the developer to choose the data type
of the key value. Therefore, if one wishes to use a string or any other hashable
object such as an int or float value as a key then it is entirely possible.
Dictionaries also have a multitude of methods and operations that can be applied to
them to make them easier to work with. Table 2-5 lists dictionary methods and
functions.

*Listing 2-19. Basic Dictionary Examples*
::
   
    # Create an empty dictionary and a populated dictionary
    
    >>> myDict={}
    
    >>> myDict.values()
    
    []
    
    # Assign key-value pairs to dictionary
    
    >>> myDict['one'] = 'first'
    
    >>> myDict['two'] = 'second'
    
    >>> myDict
    
    {'two': 'second', 'one': 'first'}

Now we will take a look at some dictionary examples. This reference will not show you
an example of using each of the dictionary methods and functions, but it should
provide you with a good enough base understanding of how they work.

*Listing 2-20. Working with Python Dictionaries*
::
    
    # Create an empty dictionary and a populated dictionary
    
    >>> mydict = {}
    
    # Try to find a key in the dictionary
    
    >>> 'firstkey' in mydict
    
    False
    
    # Add key/value pair to dictionary
    
    >>> mydict['firstkey'] = 'firstval'
    
    >>> 'firstkey' in mydict
    
    True
    
    # List the values in the dictionary
    
    >>> mydict.values()
    
    ['firstval']
    
    # List the keys in the dictionary
    
    >>> mydict.keys()
    
    ['firstkey']
    
    # Display the length of the dictionary (how many  key/value pairs are in it)
    
    >>> len(mydict)
    
    1
    
    # Print the contents of the dictionary
    
    >>> mydict
    
    {'firstkey': 'firstval'}
    
    >>>
    
    # Replace the original dictionary with a dictionary containing string-based keys
    
    # The following dictionary represents a hockey team line

    >>> myDict.get('r_wing')
    
    'Josh'
    
    >>> myDict['r_wing']
    
    'Josh'
    
    # Try to obtain the value for a key that does not exist
    
    >>> myDict['goalie']
    
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    
    File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
    
    KeyError: 'goalie'
    
    # Try to obtain a value for a key that does not exist using get()

    # Now use a default message that will be displayed if the key does not exist

Sets
----

Sets are unordered collections of unique elements. What makes sets different than
other sequence types is that they contain no indexing or duplicates. They are also
unlike dictionaries because there are no key values associated with the elements.
They are an arbitrary collection of unique elements. Sets cannot contain mutable
objects, but sets themselves can be mutable. Another thing to note is that sets are
note available to use by default, you must import set from the Sets module before
using.

*Listing 2-21. Examples of Sets*
::
    
    # In order to use a Set, we must first import it
    
    >>> from sets import Set
    
    # To create a set use the following syntax
    
    >>> myset = Set([1,2,3,4,5])
    
    >>> myset
    
    Set([5, 3, 2, 1, 4])
    
    # Add a value to the set – See Table 2-7 for more details
    
    >>> myset.add(6)
    
    >>> myset
    
    Set([6, 5, 3, 2, 1, 4])
    
    # Try to add a duplicate
    
    >>> myset.add(4)
    
    >>> myset
    
    Set([6, 5, 3, 2, 1, 4])

There are two different types of sets, namely set and frozenset. The difference
between the two is quite easily conveyed from the name itself. A regular set is a
mutable collection object, whereas a frozen set is immutable. Remember, immutable
objects cannot be altered once they have been created whereas mutable objects can be
altered after creation. Much like sequences and mapping types, sets have an
assortment of methods and operations that can be used on them. Many of the operations
and methods work on both mutable and immutable sets. However, there are a number of
them that only work on the mutable set types. In Tables 2-6 and 2-7, we’ll take a
look at the different methods and operations.

Ranges
------

The range is a special function that allows one to iterate between a range of numbers
or list a specific range of numbers. It is especially helpful for performing
mathematical iterations, but it can also be used for simple iterations.

The format for using the range function includes an optional starting number, an
ending number, and an optional stepping number. If specified, the starting number
tells the range where to begin, whereas the ending number specifies where the range
should end. The starting index is inclusive whereas the ending index is not. The
optional step number tells the range how many numbers should be placed between each
number contained within the range output. The step number is added to the previous
number and if that number exceeds the end point then the range stops.

Range Format
~~~~~~~~~~~~
::
    
    range([start], stop, [step])

*Listing 2-24. Using the Range Function*
::
    
    #Simple range starting with zero, note that the end point is not included in the
    range
    
    >>>range(0,10)
    
    [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
    
    >>> range(50, 65)
    
    [50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64]
    
    >>>range(10)
    
    [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
    
    # Include a step of two in the range
    
    >>>range(0,10,2)
    
    [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]
    
    # Including a negative step performs the same functionality...the step is added to
    the previously
    
    # number in the range
    
    >>> range(100,0,-10)
    
    [100, 90, 80, 70, 60, 50, 40, 30, 20, 10]

One of the most common uses for this function is in a for loop. The following example
displays a couple ways of using the range function within a for loop context.

*Listing 2-25. Using the Range Function Within a For Loop*
::
    
    >>> for i in range(10):
    
    ...         print i
    
    ...
    
    0
    
    1
    
    2

    # Multiplication Example
    
    >>> x = 1
    
    >>> for i in range(2, 10, 2):
    
    ...         x = x + (i * x)
    
    ...         print x
    
    ...
    
    3
    
    15
    
    105

As you can see, a range can be used to iterate through just about any number set. .
.be it going up or down, positive or negative in step. Ranges are also a good way to
create a list of numbers. In order to do so, simply pass a range to list() as shown
in the following example.

*Listing 2-26. Create a List from a Range*
::
    
    >>> my_number_list = list(range(10))
    
    >>> my_number_list
    
    [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

As you can see, not only are ranges useful for iterative purposes but they are also a
good way to create numeric lists.

Jython-specific Collections
===========================

There are a number of Jython-specific collection objects that are available for use.
Most of these collection objects are used to pass data into Java classes and so
forth, but they add additional functionality into the Jython implementation that will
assist Python newcomers that are coming from the Java world. Nonetheless, many of
these additional collection objects can be quite useful under certain situations.

In the Jython 2.2 release, Java collection integration was introduced. This enables a
bidirectional interaction between Jython and Java collection types. For instance, a
Java ArrayList can be imported in Jython and then used as if it were part of the
language. Prior to 2.2, Java collection objects could act as a Jython object, but
Jython objects could not act as Java objects. For instance, it is possible to use a
Java ArrayList in Jython and use methods such as add(), remove(), and get(). You will
see in the example below that using the add() method of an ArrayList will add an
element to the list and return a boolean to signify the success or failure of the
addition. The remove() method acts similarly, except that it removes an element
rather than adding it.

*Listing 2-27. Example of Using Java Oriented Collection in Jython*
::
    
    # Import and use a Java ArrayList
    
    >>> import java.util.ArrayList as ArrayList
    
    >>> arr = ArrayList()
    
    #  Add method will add an element to the list and return a boolean to signify
    successsful addition
    
    >>> arr.add(1)
    
    True
    
    >>> arr.add(2)
    
    True
    
    >>> print arr
    
    [1, 2]

Ahead of the integration of Java collections, Jython also had implemented the jarray
object which basically allows for the construction of a Java array in Jython. In
order to work with a jarray, simply define a sequence type in Jython and pass it to
the jarray object along with the type of object contained within the sequence. The
jarray is definitely useful for creating Java arrays and then passing them into java
objects, but it is not very useful for working in Jython objects. Moreover, all
values within a jarray must be the same type. If you try to pass a sequence
containing multiple types to a jarray then you’ll be given a TypeError of one kind or
another. See Table 2-8 for a listing of character typecodes used with jarray.

*Table 2-8. Character Typecodes for Use With Jarray*

+---------+---------------+
|Character|Java Equivalent|
+---------+---------------+
|z        |boolean        |
+---------+---------------+
|b        |byte           |
+---------+---------------+
|c        |char           |
+---------+---------------+
|d        |Double         |
+---------+---------------+
|f        |Float          |
+---------+---------------+
|h        |Short          |
+---------+---------------+
|i        |Int            |
+---------+---------------+
|l        |Long           |
+---------+---------------+


*Listing 2-28. Jarray Usage*
::
    
    >>> my_seq = (1,2,3,4,5)
    
    >>> from jarray import array
    
    >>> array(my_seq,'i')
    
    array('i', [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
    
    >>> myStr = "Hello Jython"
    
    >>> array(myStr,'c')
    
    array('c', 'Hello Jython')

Another useful feature of the jarray is that we can create empty arrays if we wish by
using the zeros() method. The zeros() method works in a similar fashion to the
array() method which we’ve already demonstrated. In order to create an array that is
empty, simply pass the length of the array along with the type to the zeros() method.
Let’s take a quick look at an example.

*Listing 2-29. Create an Empty Boolean Array*
::
    
    >>> arr = zeros(10,'z')
    
    >>> arr
    
    array('z', [False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False])

*Listing 2-30. Create an Empty Integer Array*
::
    
    >>> arr2 = zeros(6, 'i')
    
    >>> arr2
    
    array('i', [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])

In some circumstances when working with Java objects, you will need to call a Java
method that requires a Java array as an argument. Using the jarray object allows for
a simple way of creating Java arrays when needed.

Files
=====

File objects are used to read and write data to a file on disk. The file object is
used to obtain a reference to the file on disk and open it for reading, writing,
appending, or a number of different tasks. If we simply use the open(filename[,
mode]) function, we can return a file object and assign it to a variable for
processing. If the file does not yet exist on disk, then it will automatically be
created. The mode argument is used to tell what type of processing we wish to perform
on the file. This argument is optional and if omitted then the file is opened in
read-only mode. See Table 2-9.

*Table 2-9. Modes of Operations for File Types*

+-----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|Mode |Description                                                                  |
+-----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|‘r’  |read only                                                                    |
+-----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|‘w’  |write (Note:  This overwrites anything else in the file, so use with caution)|

|‘a’  |append                                                                       |

*Listing 2-31.*
::
    
    # Open a file and assign it to variable f
    
    >>> f = open('newfile.txt','w')

There are plenty of methods that can be used on file objects for manipulation of the
file content. We can call read([size]) on a file in order to read its content. Size
is an optional argument here and it is used to tell how much content to read from the
file. If it is omitted then the entire file content is read. The readline() method
can be used to read a single line from a file. readlines([size]) is used to return a
list containing all of the lines of data that are contained within a file. Again,
there is an optional size parameter that can be used to tell how many bytes from the
file to read. If we wish to place content into the file, the write(string) method
does just that. The write() method writes a string to the file.

When writing to a file it is oftentimes important to know exactly what position in
the file you are going to write to. There are a group of methods to help us out with
positioning within a file using integers to represent bytes in the file. The tell()
method can be called on a file to give the file object’s current position. The
integer returned is in a number of bytes and is an offset from the beginning of the
file. The seek(offset, from) method can be used to change position in a file. The
offset is the number in bytes of the position you’d like to go, and from represents
the place in the file where you’d like to calculate the offset from. If from equals
0, then the offset will be calculated from the beginning of the file. Likewise, if it
equals 1 then it is calculated from the current file position, and 2 will be from the
end of the file. The default is 0 if from is omitted.

Lastly, it is important to allocate and de-allocate resources efficiently in our
programs or we will incur a memory overhead and leaks. Resources are usually handled
a bit differently between CPython and Jython because garbage collection acts
differently. In CPython, it is not as important to worry about de-allocating
resources as they are automatically de-allocated when they go out of scope. The JVM
does note immediately garbage collect, so proper de-allocation of resources is more
important. The close() method should be called on a file when we are through working
with it. The proper methodology to use when working with a file is to open, process,
and then close each time. However, there are more efficient ways of performing such
tasks. In Chapter 7 we will discuss the use of context managers to perform the same
functionality in a more efficient manner.

*Listing 2-32. File Manipulation in Python*
::
    
    # Create a file, write to it, and then read its content
    
    >>> f = open('newfile.txt','r+')
    
    >>> f.write('This is some new text for our file\n')
    
    >>> f.write('This should be another line in our file\n')
    
    #  No lines will be read because we are at the end of the written content
    
    >>> f.read()
    
    ''
    
    >>> f.readlines()
    
    []
    
    >>> f.tell()
    
    75L
    
    # Move our position back to the beginning of the file
    
    >>> f.seek(0)
    
    >>> f.read()
    
    'This is some new text for our file\nThis should be another line in our file\n'
    
    >>> f.seek(0)
    
    >>> f.readlines()
    
    ['This is some new text for our file\n', 'This should be another line in our file\n']
    
    # Closing the file to de-allocate
    
    >>> f.close()

Iterators
=========

The iterator  was introduced into Python back in version 2.2. It allows for iteration
over Python containers. All iterable containers have built-in support for the
iterator type. For instance, sequence objects are iterable as they allow for
iteration over each element within the sequence. If you try to return an iterator on
an object that does not support iteration, you will most likely receive an
AttributeError which tells you that __iter__ has not been defined as an attribute for
that object. It is important to note that Python method names using
double-underscores are special  methods. For instance, in Python a class can be
initialized using the __init__() method. . .much like a Java constructor. For more
details on classes and special class methods, please refer to Chapter 7.

Iterators allow for easy access to sequences and other iterable containers. Some
containers such as dictionaries have specialized iteration methods built into them as
you have seen in previous sections. Iterator objects are required to support two main
methods that form the iterator protocol. Those methods are defined below in Table
2-10.To return an iterator on a container, just assign container.__iter__()  to some
variable. That variable will become the iterator for the object. This affords one the
ability to pass iterators around, into functions and the like. The iterator is then
itself like a changing variable that maintains its state. We can use work with the
iterator without affecting the original object. If using the next() call, it will
continue to return the next item within the list until all items have been retrieved.
Once this occurs, a StopIteration  exception is issued. The important thing to note
here is that we are actually creating a copy of the list when we return the iterator
and assign it to a variable. That variable returns and removes an item from that copy
each time the next() method is called on it. If we continue to call next() on the
iterator variable until the StopIteration error is issued, the variable will no
longer contain any items and is empty. For instance, if we created an iterator from a
list then called the next() method on it until it had retrieved all values then the
iterator would be empty and the original list would be left untouched.

*Listing 2-33. Create an Iterator from a List and Use It*
::
    
    >>> hockey_roster = ['Josh', 'Leo', 'Frank', 'Jim', 'Vic']
    
    >>> hockey_itr = hockey_roster.__iter__()
    
    >>> hockey_itr = hockey_roster.__iter__()
    
    >>> hockey_itr.next()
    
    'Josh'
    
    >>> for x in hockey_itr:
    
    ...     print x

    File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>

    World!

Referencing and Copies
======================

Creating copies and referencing items in the Python language is fairly
straightforward. The only thing you’ll need to keep in mind is that the techniques
used to copy mutable and immutable objects differ a bit.

In order to create a copy of an immutable object, you simply assign it to a different
variable. The new variable is an exact copy of the object. If you attempt to do the
same with a mutable object, you will actually just create a reference to the original
object. Therefore, if you perform operations on the “copy” of the original then the
same operation will actually be performed on the original. This occurs because the
new assignment references the same mutable object in memory as the original. It is
kind of like someone calling you by a different name. One person may call you by your
birth name and another may call you by your nickname, but both names will reference
you of course.

*Listing 2-35. Working with Copies*
::
    
    # Strings are immutable, so when you assign a string to another variable, it creates
    a real copy
    
    >>> mystring = "I am a string, and I am an immutable object"
    
    >>> my_copy = mystring
    
    >>> my_copy
    
    'I am a string, and I am an immutable object'
    
    >>> mystring
    
    'I am a string, and I am an immutable object'
    
    >>> my_copy = "Changing the copy of mystring"
    
    >>> my_copy
    
    'Changing the copy of mystring'
    
    >>> mystring
    
    'I am a string, and I am an immutable object'
    
    # Lists are mutable objects, so assigning a list to a variable
    
    # creates a reference to that list. Changing one of these variables will also
    
    # change the other one – they are just references to the same object.
    
    >>> listA = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
    
    >>> print listA
    
    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
    
    >>> listB = listA
    
    >>> print listB
    
    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
    
    >>> del listB[2]
    
    # Oops, we’ve altered the original list!
    
    >>> print listA
    
    [1, 2, 4, 5, 6]
    
    # If you want a new list which contains the same things, but isn't just a reference
    
    # to your original list, you need the copy module
    
    >>> import copy
    
    >>> a = [[]]
    
    >>> b = copy.copy(a)
    
    >>> b
    
    [[]]
    
    # b is not the same list as a, just a copy
    
    >>> b is a
    
    False
    
    # But the list b[0] is the same the same list as the list a[0], and changing one will
    
    # also change the other. This is what is known as a shallow copy – a and b are
    
    # different at the top level, but if you go one level down, you have references to
    
    # to the same things – if you go deep enough, it's not a copy,
    
    # it's the same object.
    
    >>> b[0].append('test')
    
    >>> a
    
    [['test']]
    
    >>> b

To effectively create a copy of a mutable object, you have two choices. You can
either create what is known as a shallow copy or a deep copy of the original object.
The difference is that a shallow copy of an object will create a new object and then
populate it with references to the items that are contained in the original object.
Hence, if you modify any of those items then each object will be affected since they
both reference the same items.

A deep copy creates a new object and then recursively copies the contents of the
original object into the new copy. Once you perform a deep copy of an object then you
can perform operations on any object contained in the copy without affecting the
original. You can use the deepcopy function in the copy module of the Python standard
library to create such a copy. Let’s look at some more examples of creating copies in
order to give you a better idea of how this works.

*Listing 2-36.*
::
    
    # Create an integer variable, copy it, and modify the copy
    
    >>> a = 5
    
    >>> b = a
    
    >>> print b
    
    5
    
    >>> b = a * 5
    
    >>> b
    
    25
    
    >>> a
    
    5
    
    # Create a deep copy of the list and modify it
    
    >>> import copy
    
    >>> listA = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
    
    >>> listB = copy.deepcopy(listA)
    
    >>> print listB
    
    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
    
    >>> del listB[2]
    
    >>> print listB
    
    [1, 2, 4, 5, 6]
    
    >>> print listA
    
    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

Garbage Collection
==================

This is one of those major differences between CPython and Jython. In CPython, an
object is garbage collected when it goes out of scope or is no longer needed. This
occurs automatically and rarely needs to be tracked by the developer. Behind the
scenes, CPython uses a reference counting technique to maintain a count on each
object which effectively determines if the object is still in use. Unlike CPython,
Jython does not implement a reference counting technique for aging out or garbage
collection unused objects. Instead, Jython makes use of the garbage collection
mechanisms that the Java platform provides. When a Jython object becomes stale or
unreachable, the JVM may or may not reclaim it. One of the main aspects of the JVM
that made developers so happy in the early days is that there was no longer a need to
worry about cleaning up after your code. In the C programming language, one must
maintain an awareness of which objects are currently being used so that when they are
no longer needed the program would perform some clean up. Not in the Java world, the
gc thread on the JVM takes care of all garbage collection and cleanup for you.

Even though we haven’t spoken about classes in detail yet, you saw a short example of
how them in Chapter 1. It is a good time to mention that Python provides a mechanism
for object cleanup. A finalizer method can be defined in any class in order to ensure
that the garbage collector performs specific tasks. Any cleanup code that needs to be
performed when an object goes out of scope can be placed within this finalizer
method. It is important to note that the finalizer method cannot be counted on as a
method which will always be invoked when an object is stale. This is the case because
the finalizer method is invoked by the Java garbage collection thread, and there is
no way to be sure when and if the garbage collector will be called on an object.
Another issue of note with the finalizer is that they incur a performance penalty. If
you’re coding an application that already performs poorly then it may not be a good
idea to throw lots of finalizers into it.

The following is an example of a Python finalizer. It is an instance method that must
be named __del__.

*Listing 2-37. Python Finalizer Example*
::
    
    class MyClass:
    
    def __del__(self):
    
    pass    # Perform some cleanup here

The downside to using the JVM garbage collection mechanisms is that there is really
no guarantee as to when and if an object will be reclaimed. Therefore, when working
with performance intensive objects it is best to not rely on a finalizer to be
called. It is always important to ensure that proper coding techniques are used in
such cases when working with objects like files and databases. Never code the close()
method for a file into a finalizer because it may cause an issue if the finalizer is
not invoked. Best practice is to ensure that all mandatory cleanup activities are
performed before a finalizer would be invoked.

Summary
=======

A lot of material was covered in this chapter. You should be feeling better
acquainted with Python after reading through this material. We began the chapter by
covering the basics of assignment an assigning data to particular objects or data
types. You learned that working with each type of data object opens different doors
as the way we work with each type of data object differs. Our journey into data
objects began with numbers and strings, and we discussed the many methods available
to the string object. We learned that strings are part of the sequence family of
Python collection objects along with lists and tuples. We covered how to create and
work with lists, and the variety of options available to us when using lists. You
discovered that list comprehensions can help create copies of a given list and
manipulate their elements according to an expression or function. After discussing
lists, we went on to discuss dictionaries, sets and tuples.

After discussing the collection types, we learned that Jython has its own set of
collection objects that differ from those in Python. We can leverage the advantage of
having the Java platform at our fingertips and use Java collection types from within
Jython. We finished up by discussing referencing, copies, and garbage collection.
Creating different copies of objects does not always give you what you’d expect, and
that Jython garbage collection differs quite a bit from that of Python.

The next chapter will help you to combine some of the topics you’ve learned about in
this chapter as you will learn how to define expressions and work with control flow.
