<h2>Josh Juneau<a class="headerlink" href="#josh-juneau" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Josh Juneau has been a software developer since the mid 1990’s.  He graduated
from Northern Illinois University with a degree in Computer Science.  His career
began as an Oracle database administrator which later led into PL/SQL development
and database programming.  Josh began to use Java along with PL/SQL for developing
web applications, and later shifted to Java as a primary base for application
development. Josh has worked with Java in the form of web, GUI, and command-line
programming for several years. During his tenure as a Java developer, he has
worked with many frameworks including JSP, JSF, EJB, and JBoss Seam. At the same
time, Josh expanded his usage of the JVM by developing applications with other
JVM languages such as Jython and Groovy. Since 2006, Josh has been the editor and publisher for the Jython Monthly newsletter.
In late 2008, he began a podcast dedicated to the Jython programming language.  More modern releases of
Jython have enabled Josh to begin using it as one of the primary languages for his professional development.
Currently Josh spends his days developing Java and Jython applications, and working with Oracle databases.
When he is not working, he enjoys spending time with his family.  Josh also sneaks in enough time to maintain
the jython.org website, hack on the Jython language, and work on other such projects.  He can be contacted
via his blog at <a class="reference external" href="http://www.jj-blogger.blogspot.com">http://www.jj-blogger.blogspot.com</a>.</p>

<h2>Jim Baker<a class="headerlink" href="#jim-baker" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Jim Baker has over 15 years of software development experience, focusing on business intelligence,
enterprise application integration, and high-performance web applications. He is a member of the
Python Software Foundation and a committer on Jython. Jim has presented at Devoxx, EuroPython, JavaOne,
and the Python Conference, as well at numerous user groups. He is a graduate of both Harvard and Brown.</p>

<h2>Victor Ng<a class="headerlink" href="#victor-ng" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Victor Ng has been slinging Python code in enterprises for 10 years and has worked in the banking,
adventure travel, and telecommunications industries. Victor attended the University of Waterloo where
he was busy learning to cook and didn’t attend too many classes. He lives just outside of Toronto,
Ontario, in Canada.</p>

<div class="section" id="leo-soto">
<h2>Leo Soto<a class="headerlink" href="#leo-soto" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Leonardo Soto is part of the Jython development team since the middle of 2008, after a successfully completed Google
Summer of Code Project that aimed to run and integrate the Django web framework with Jython. He is also finishing his
thesis to get the Informatics Engineering title from  the Universidad de Santiago de Chile and works on Continuum, a Chilean software boutique.</p>
<p>Leo has developed several software systems in the past seven years, most of them being web applications, and most of
them based on the JavaEE (formerly J2EE) platform. However, he has been spoiled by Python since the start of his professional
developer career, and he has missed its power and clarity countless times, which inexorably turned him toward the Jython project.</p>

<h2>Frank Wierzbicki<a class="headerlink" href="#frank-wierzbicki" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Frank Wierzbicki is the head of the Jython project and a lead software
developer at Sauce Labs. He has been programming since the Commodore
64 was the king of home computers (look it up kids!) and can&#8217;t imagine
why anyone would do anything else for a living. Frank&#8217;s most enduring
hobby is picking up new programming languages, but he has yet to find
one that is more fun to work with than Python.</p>
